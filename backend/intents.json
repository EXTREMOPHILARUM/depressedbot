I can relate to a lot of what you are writing about, especially the part about being in a long-term relationship and waiting for the next step that never seems to come. It really, truly sucks. On top of that, I'm in a bad situation that life has thrown at me and that I can't do anything about... and it just makes you feel hopeless.\n\nSo what I'm saying is... I'm not in a place to really cheer you up, but I think I can relate. Please know that you are not alone. And maybe you will find some comfort in that. I'm sending you a hug, wherever you are.",

I've been a paramedic for almost 2 decades, and I can commiserate about seeing shitty and sad things. And life stuff on top of that can just be too much. I feel you there. Do you find any joy in any moments of the day? Or activities? I definitely suggest being heard out by a professional. Feeling validated in how you feel can be empowering.",

                "Thank you for replying. I'm not sure where to seek help at work - I have friends I can confide in but I almost feel stupid considering where I work! I don't really feel like I can confide in my manager she's not a very caring person! Struggling to find joy in much at the moment. I am so bored. My daily routine is the same every day. Perhaps I do need to see a professional. Thank you again.",

Don't feel stupid, hospitals can be the hardest place to get help and support sometimes! Like the humans who work there come low on the list. It also could be \"burn out\" or \"compassion fatigue\", may be intertwined with depression or PTSD. That's where I professional can offer an unbiased educated opinion. Best wishes"

You're 18 with a business that makes a lot of money, and you're an athletic guy who takes care of themselves physically. You have a lot to be proud of. I despise using this word, but if anything, you can say you were ignorant. We all have tremendous opportunities that pass us by and we didn't even realize it until we look back. It's great that you had this vision of what high school would be, and it sucks that you couldn't achieve it. But honestly, high school is probably the worst place to find true love, since most people haven't matured enough to understand what it means to be in a loving relationship. Although you didn't like the way that girl looked, the real reason you turned her down was because you didn't want to be heartbroken, and you wanted something real; you didn't care about having a fling or having someone on your arm. Believe it or not, that shows tremendous character.\nIt's super difficult to see it now (I'm still struggling), but high school is not real life. Now that you're entering a new stage in your life, the system is different. You're going to be meeting people interested in the things you are and who can appreciate who you are as a person, and not as sometime to hang out with at lunch every day. It's hard to look back and know that you'll never be able to take that girl to prom and homecoming, but when you meet someone who you love and really loves you, it won't matter. It's all about looking forward. It's a hard pill to swallow, but try and put that dream on the shelf along with your past dreams of being a rockstar or an astronaut. In the end, you'll see that you having a dream like that shows you who you are and what you value. You can't see what you'll become if you don't stay to watch.\nHope you feel better soon, I'm right here with you! \u2764\ufe0f",

Maybe I am a romantic but the whole high school relationship just sounded like the best a relationship could get. Maybe it has been glorified that way to me by movies but I want to have moments like that with someone more than I want anything else on this earth. I just feel as if it is over.

And now that I have breathing space I can actually see why I couldn't do it: I just had absolutely no executive function spare to make myself wash dishes or brush my teeth. It was all being used up on surviving; not crying while doing something mildly unpleasant; scolding myself to smile and react normally in social situations; trying to feel positive emotions while talking to my husband instead of just sleepwalking through my days in a vascillating haze of anhedonia or emotional collapse.\n\nIn short, sometimes medications are useful emergency intervention and a welcome respite.",

It wasn't about how great people were to me, or the opportunities I had. I'm on medication now and I finally don't feel miserable all the time for no reason.

I worked construction, thought I loved it, but I realized I was always miserable so I switched jobs. My wife says I am far happier, my bouts of deep depression are rare and since I have a doctor I see who can issue me mood stabilizers when I do have those bouts, they are short lived. Depression can be bio chemical or situational and unless you are going to go get a full medical work up to figure things out, trying to identify which is yours can just make you more depressed. I do recommend a good psychologist, it can feel embarrassing to have one but the rewards are worth the discomfort."

Happiness comes and goes relative to what we are experiencing in the moment. What people are really striving for is actually contentment, whether they realise it or not.\n\nSpeak with someone you trust, or  perhaps a doctor directly, if you feel uncertain about telling a parent. Things can get better. Being young can be really tough, but a lot of the time, adulthood brings confidence and determination, hobbies, relationships, goals, etc that can bring a level of contentment and makes life worthwhile.

                "Hey! I feel ya!!!! The good news is that you can beat your depression!!! \n\nMy partner had depression for many many years!! He was on meds for a long time, he went to counseling (I even went with him to know better how to help him and to learn to not let his depression get to me - because it certainly does!)\n\nSo here is what worked:\n1. Regular exercise. It doesn\u2019t need to be every day. Start with a commitment of going to the gym once a week. And stick with that! Don\u2019t expect miracles and give up after 1 month because you are not feeling happier. \nAlso, in order to be effective, the exercise needs to elevate your heart beat for 30 minutes or so (therapist recommendation). We enrolled in a cardio class, so we stay more motivated than walking in the boring treadmill. \n\n2. Meditation/mindful classes. Game changer! It really helps and there are tons os studies proving that it can be as effective as meds!! This was another of the therapist\u2019s recommendation. \nCan\u2019t find one in your community? There is tons online! \n\n3. Healthy diet. Tons of veggies and fruits. No soda! Cut the crappy sugar! ;-)\n\n4. Take a vitamin D supplement. Go on short walks 2 or 3 times a week. Keep active! \n\n5.

                "1. Thanks. I have been trying getting back into exercise, which has been really hard because when my heart rate increases, I can't breathe and I have a panic attack. Like I said, it's really bad right now, so a lot triggers it. I also went to the Dr. and said my thyroid feels big which could be bringing on the feeling of not being able to breathe when exercising, so that's being worked on too. \n2. the mindful meditation, works sometimes, other times it is pure torture, my mind becomes obsessive and will work myself into a panic. I try that first though, sometimes it works, sometimes it makes it a lot worse. I did a salt float therapy, which was great meditation, but expensive. \n3. My diet is improving, when it was real bad, I was just accepting that I was actually eating, no matter what it was. \n4. I have always been on heaps of Vitamin D, I've always been so so low\n5. Books, I listened to the Subtle art of Not Giving a F*ck, as I tried to lay and calm at the same time, it made it worse, I'm not sure why, but I can try again. I wen't a little crazy and rented every single mental health and coping book from my library over a few months and got too overwhelmed because I can't comprehend the amount of info. My therapist says I need to rein it in back to what is in my immediate life, not search for every single possibility because I just can't process that amount of information right now. So when I go off and spiral I have to remind myself, \"Bring it back in, that's going too far\"\n\nI also just wake up with the feeling of fear, so just waking up triggers it, which is intense and really hard to have the time to meditate or do some things before work except take half a xanax and try and calm once I'm at work."

                "I know what your going through. When I was younger I was constantly bullied in school (middle school), by all of my cousins (and not in the fun way. In the \u201cthey treat me like crap because they can\u201d way). My family life is not at all healthy. I have problems that were caused by my family life. I myself also have health problems which suck. They really do (including anxiety. Not so depression but I have had depression last a long time but that was when my family life was extremely terrible. It\u2019s ok now, but a few years ago it was awful). But I keep moving forward. And I know it\u2019s hard. There are days that I want to end it. Where I just think I\u2019d be better off dead. And these aren\u2019t just thoughts that happened years ago. These are thoughts that have happened in the past week. Through my high school I had no friends. And the people I thought were my friends used me and I found out way to late. I wasn\u2019t at all what you\u2019d call handsome. I wasn\u2019t fit. I wasn\u2019t strong. I was just me. And I hated it. I wanted to end it. I really did. But I didn\u2019t  because of the thought life gets better. And I know you may not believe it now. But it does. My life is way better than it was back when I was 15/16/17. And I\u2019m only 19. I\u2019m so happy now. I promise you life will get better. No matter what your going through. A lot of us do have health problems so know that your not the only one. (For example, I have a degenerative knee cap. I think that is what\u2019s it\u2019s called. It\u2019s been so long when I first found out I forget. I have messed up my back to where I could be paralyzed if I\u2019m not careful and a few more health issues). So know that your not the only one. We all have parents who don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re going through. Mine certainly don\u2019t. Just know that we know what your going through. And know that life will get better. And it may not seem like it now. But from my experience, it does. And I can 100% promise you it will. Please do not end your life. Please push through. I hope I am able to help in some way. If you ever need help with anything, you can PM me. I\u2019ll be more than happy to help.",
                "Hey girl, I see you. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re posting here because that shows you really want some help. I can offer some advice or just share a little about my life, just something so you know I hear you. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered with depression and anxiety since I was a pre teen, and I say always say suffered because depression will take you to some dark places and it is a STRUGGLE. I\u2019m not saying this to make you feel like you might as well give up or anything like that, just to be crystal clear. I just want you to know that living with and managing this stuff is possible but you have to fight like hell and never let your guard down. You can take this as a burden you are saddled with or you can take it as a purpose. You know a lot of people go through life with no real purpose, but here you are, all set up with a purpose for the rest of your life. \n\nYour purpose is to not let \u201cit\u201d win. You can\u2019t. You didn\u2019t ask for this but here it is, trying to leech all of the good out of life, making you feel unloved, taking your motivation and your joy. It\u2019s not fair but you don\u2019t have to take it. Fight it with all you have. I mean it. We weren\u2019t put on this earth to feel like that all the time and if our brain chemicals tend to disagree we have to work around the little messes they make. It\u2019s entirely possible and if I can do it, you can do it. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I can tell you: \n\nDon\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel bad for having mental health issues. Some people are really misinformed and some are just mean spirited but they can only make you feel as bad as you let them. Imagine making someone feel bad for having diabetes or lupus, it sounds ridiculous but people can be assholes. Don\u2019t be afraid to let them know they are being an asshole either. And don\u2019t YOU ever feel like you are less or broken or weak because you struggle with your mental health. You didn\u2019t do anything to cause this. \n\nTry antidepressants. I know some people disagree with this and you will make the best choice for you but - it\u2019s 2019, they make medicine for this stuff. It\u2019s not a perfect science but considering all you have to lose without trying to treat it, I think the benefits outweigh the risks. \n\nBUT, don\u2019t let a doctor just give you antidepressants without agreeing to monitor and adjust those meds every couple months, like I said not perfect and honestly a pain in the ass, but you\u2019ll feel better. \n\nDo not just take meds without counseling or therapy. Sure, the meds work on your brain chemistry, but combining them with talk therapy increases the efficacy of the drugs. You can take therapy breaks and still take the meds, but get yourself a good, solid foundation first. \n\nGo to counseling/therapy. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and costs money you\u2019d rather spend on something else but you\u2019ll be surprised how totally off your thinking can get. Someone who can help you reframe the way your brain looks at things will help more than you think. \n\nSwitch counselors or therapists as needed and don\u2019t feel bad about it. You\u2019re going to have to like and connect with this person to get any real value. But therapists are just humans and not all humans are compatible, so just be very patient and find one you click with. It\u2019ll work so much better. \n\nEat well and take vitamins &amp; supplements, drink plenty of good old water and exercise as much as you can. Get the best possible sleep you can every night. This took me a long time to come to terms with, but once I did I started feeling a lot better. Who knew that my struggling brain needed better fuel than Taco Bell &amp; Pepsi to function and that the symptoms of dehydration can mimic a lot of mental health issues? And just FYI I SUCK at exercising and I\u2019m not saying train for a marathon, just do something you enjoy as frequently as possible. \n\nTake a social media break. If you are bombarded by pics of what seems to be everyone else\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d life, it\u2019ll mess with you. Keep in mind, all that perfectness is just on the surface. Even during my worst times, where all I could think about was swallowing all my pills, I posted every selfie I could to prove how \u201chappy\u201d I was. It\u2019s all a lie. \n\nDon\u2019t self medicate. Just don\u2019t. We Americans man, we know how to kill our feelings and there are 100 ways to do it.  Booze, pot, video games...whatever we need to check out, it\u2019s pretty easy to get. I\u2019m not saying this because I am some saint or anything, I\u2019m saying it because I\u2019ve tried all of it and it doesn\u2019t help. Seems like it for just a minute and then everything gets worse. Depending on what you get into, you could slip and saddle yourself with an addiction on top of the other issues and trust me you do not want that. Not only will it probably set you back years in trying to feel better, addiction can steal everything from you. And when you have nothing left it will go after your family, friends and anyone around you. I really don\u2019t want to sound preachy, but it is SO EASY for people like me and you to do this and I\u2019ve lived enough years to see some of the worst shit addiction can do and I do not want that for you. So just be so careful around drugs and alcohol.  There are people who can mess around with them with no worries, but if you\u2019re already feeling as bad as your post says on the inside, it\u2019s just too easy to slip into something you might never come out of. Just keep your guard up ok? \n\nGo easy on yourself. There are going to be some shitty days and if you can\u2019t get out of bed once in awhile, stay in bed if you can. If a week has taken everything out of you just to get through, who cares what your house/room/car/whatever looks like. That shit can wait and sometimes you have to rest without feeling guilty. \n\nSounds so easy right? Oh yeah, I\u2019ll just get up and do all that right away! IGET it. When you\u2019re depressed it\u2019s like wearing 100 lb weights on all your limbs. Everything seems gray and the stuff you used to like doesn\u2019t matter and you are just so tired. There\u2019s been months where I only made it from the couch to work and back and nothing else. Months. Where the only thing that would bring me any comfort was thinking about dying and how I could just end all of this. Where I barely showered, ate whatever I could pick up at a fast food joint...just laid there. I get it. I got all the advice like \u201cJust go outside!\u201d  Sure, I haven\u2019t had the energy to brush my teeth in 3 days but I\u2019ll get right on that.  Just start with one baby step. Just one. Call your doctor and make an appointment. Show up to the appointment. Be honest at the appointment about how bad it is. Tell someone what\u2019s going on and if you don\u2019t have anyone in your life you can talk to, talk to the peeps in some of these subreddits. DM me anytime. Posting here was a good baby step! I know everything is so exhausting right now but I promise you if you do one thing towards getting yourself better it will lead to more and more steps and little by little you\u2019ll get better, not perfect, but better. Remember people like you and I have to have a little bit of extra fight in us because of our purpose. You can do this. Read that again. You can do this. You can have a life with good times and friends and all the things that come along and you are going to learn how to handle the bad stuff in a different way. Just fight with me, ok? \n\nI\u2019m here.",

Either way, here we go OP &amp; anyone else reading this, I hope this helps.\n\n\n\nFirstly, even when we feel like we're burdening others, whether it's because we're depressed or need someone there for us, usually it isn't that black &amp; white.\nWhen it's someone who cares about us, people likely are willing &amp; want to go out of their way to help/comfort us, it's how we can reassure one another that we're there when things are hard. If it's with someone we're not quite as familiar with, some people can be everything but helpful, but other times people like to help simply because they know what it's like to struggle, either like we do or similiarly, or they do it out of the kindness of their heart.\n\nOur environment can seem very cold &amp; dark, it is, but not all of it. There may not be many, but there are good people. And those types of people don't feel burdened, they feel trusted &amp; warmth because we let them in, let them help us. It's part of having healthy relationships, a concept that I struggle with as well.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry your parents are so tough on you, I know what you mean, but when it comes to forgetting your social anxiety, overthinking, &amp; depression, that is everything but fair. They should be more considerate &amp; supportive, they're doing the opposite. I don't know how open or comfortable you are with talking to them, but mabe taking one of them aside or so &amp; trying to explain to them a bit what the screaming &amp; other stuff does to you can help enlighten them. I know that would be difficult, but hopefully it wouldn't make it worse, it might be worth a try. It's suprising how much a honest conversation can do, but both sides have to be open to that.\n\n\nThere is no absolute way of knowing that life will get better &amp; that you will be happy. Life is a cold heartless bitch that takes &amp; rarely gives something in return. It's chaotic. But it does have it's ups &amp; downs, mostly our lives oscillates between those, things don't stay bad &amp; good things &amp; people come and go. Losing people... it's another subject, perhaps, but not everyone is meant to stay, the same way not all feelings &amp; situations will stay forever. Some things will stay, some of the unhappiness, some of the emptiness, a few suicidal thoughts....\nBut that doesn't mean we can't fight them. I know you're probably tired of hearing this, or just combating these things in general, but every time we try to push back a little bit, confront those dark thoughts &amp; feeling, every time we make just a little bit more progress. And that's the best we can do. Slowly but surely. Of course that doesn't guarantee things will be better, but it means that things will be able.\n\nAnd then there are things &amp; people &amp; events that make taking those steps towards improving our situation harder. Like that creepy, disgusting old man. It might happen again, there seems to be no limit as to how many people can't keep their mouths shut, hands to themselves, &amp; use common sense &amp; respect other people. Assholes like that exist. But that doesn't mean we or our future is defined by people like them.\nBeing alone, or feeling like we are, does that too. Both are valid &amp; make every challenge we face harder.\n\n---\n\nI know you think that it's impossible for anyone to like or care about you. I feel that way too. But even with our imperfections, we're still loveable, still worthy of being cared about.\nOthers in the past, present, &amp; future may treat us terribly. Rarely it's justified, but sometimes people just don't get what it's like to be the way we are. We are different, in some ways. But that doesn't mean we're broken or messed up. It doesn't mean we aren't human or have the same rights. We're still who we are &amp; that means that despite everything, we aren't worthless. I know you don't believe me, I barely do myself, but I know that you &amp; I have done things that have meant something before. Our actions aren't as meaningless as we think, we influence the people we are around everyday, &amp; no, I don't just mean negatively.\n\nI'm sorry your friends &amp; sister didn't ask if you want to join them &amp; that your parents were so insensitive. It isn't you being emotional or anything, it sounds very familiar &amp; I'm guessing these types of things have been happening a lot recently &amp; it's built up to you feeling like this. Regardless of whether we have people who care about us all around us, very few or them, or next to none, we can still feel very, very alone.\n\nI hope really badly that you're parents are somewhat supportive or that perhaps you have someone to talk to, even though it doesn't sound like it. Friends. It's a difficult topic, but even if you don't have any, that doesn't mean your worthless or broken or unattractive. It just means you struggle, like others, to perhaps forge new connections. I know it's not easy, ever since I was a child I didn't really have anyone who was there, &amp; even as I grew up, I felt as though every left me eventually, if we connected to begin with.\n\nSolitude, whether like that or in another form does things too us, but even then it doesn't ban us from ever making important relationships with beautiful people.\n\n---\n\nI know how that sounds, but even with the mental illnesses &amp; other factors, you aren't undesireable or unloveable. You aren't. This isn't convincing, but it's about who you are on the inside, despite all these other things that may make up part of you, but absolutely, definitely not all of you. These things only define you if you let them, I know there are other much more defining features.\n\nEven if you're depressed &amp; have anxiety &amp; these other things, you can still be a charming &amp; an amazing person who is capable of achieving her goals. Yes, it makes things more difficult at times, but that does not make them impossible.\n\nI'm not always/often sure, but I hope &amp; think that all this pain we endure will &amp; is worth it. That despite all our hardships &amp; the suffering, the pain &amp; endless loss, that we can make the best out of what we have &amp; perhaps somehow, eventually, with a lot of effort that won't always be there, be able to be happier &amp; do/have what we want.\n\nYou already said you're on meds, but I think talking to someone would be critical to helping you feel a little better. At the very least finding a healthy way for you to voice &amp; confront your thoughts &amp; emotions. I know, I know, therapy &amp;/or being honest about we feel can be terrifying, but seriously, if we aren't will to accept something has to change, we can't move forward.\n\nYou are absolutely more than welcome to reply to this (write me) incase this isn't a throwaway or something, if you need someone to talk to I'm here. I would be more than happy too, you wouldn't be bothering me at all. I'm here.\n\nYou don't have to be alone. Reaching out to someone, whether online or irl can be really helpful. You can always ask for advice or someone to talk to on other subreddits if you like:\n\nr/depression\nr/helpme\nr/KindVoice\nr/offmychest\nr/SuicideWatch\n(etc.)\n\nI'm sorry things have been so hard for you, in general &amp; especially lately. I wish you the best of luck, I hope this helped, &amp; don't hesitate to let me know if I can do anything else."

Just tell them how you feel, and how you've been feeling that way for weeks. Tell them how it's been affecting you. Let them know you want to handle this issue now.

The self which is created by thinking which is the past is responsible for all this. The division, me and you, my country not yours, divorces, hurting others, falling into the ilussion of individuality... He didn't love you in the first place. Having a self denies love, he loves ideas and beliefs and the sense of becoming someone when in fact is there is no one to become. He is just dead memories, the movement of that gives him the idea that he is living. But in actuality he lives in a virtual reality, he never loved, smelled, sensed beauty. His thoughts which are actually not his but of society cause we are the product of the bs and ilussions they sell us, love and sex, which is just pleasurable activity of the demand of thought to feel something.\nLove as we know it implies me and you. In that there is division, conflict therefore limited. All memory based, two entities, two images that are given the impression that they talk. But you don't know him, you think you love him. What you love is the image of his. All that is meaningless, no one can accept this harsh truth....we operate partially, only thinking(memory) operates. All other senses are dormant. How can there be love, a sense of union, something beyond thought, not falling in love but the sense of that energy when memory is active and thinking about myself, my problems, my job...\nCheck out j krishnamurti. It's really profound. There is nothing more meaningful in life than the truth. It's on YouTube. The truth is the real meaning which is what you said the life we live which is thinking is fundamentally meaningless and destructive. With all its beliefs, ilussions etc. I really doubt if there is real love anymore... So it's important to find out what is thinking in itself. \nKrishnamurti points out to some shocking facts.

The answer of meaning is a difficult one because it's hard to break down. But youre right there isn't a  \"THE meaning of life\" depending on who you ask the meaning of life is different. And it honestly means what you make it since everyone opinion is subjective. I wish my purpose was just handed to me at birth but unfortunately that's not the state of affairs. The fact that others have suffered much more than us is also a good way of reminding yourself it's not that bad. Consider that water heaters we're invented In 1970 and weren't ubiquitous til 1990, we have a personal hot Oasis whenever we need.

Your comments indicate that you are intelligent and caring. Look for a therapeutic venue where those traits are valued. I have been fortunate to have found a group that can participate in discussions where there is trust and respect and privacy, where the healing and progress that comes from catharsis is possible. You clearly have a lot to offer, and a lot to process. I know that my own condition has often been too much for some people to handle -  I have had to learn to accept that and forgive them, and me, so that I could continue to love them, and know that they continue to love me even though they don't have the necessary skills to deal with my depression. This is not uncommon. Keep trying, keep talking, and know that you are being heard and valued.

Denial, is a strange thing, it is a lie that we tell ourselves and the more we convince ourselves, the sicker we become.  So, let me ask you this...  When you try to confront your mother about your feelings and beliefs, does she become defensive, tell you that is nonsense, accuse you of wasting time?  This type of defensive emotional response is the signature of denial, which is basically people trying to hide the things they are ashamed of.\n\nTry to accept her and find someone different, someone safe you can talk to.  There is a very good chance your mother is in denial and the more you try to get her to see your side, the more depressed you will become.  We cannot change someone else's mind, when they are in denial.  Accept her as she is and return the focus to doing things that bring you joy.

I eventually told my parents and my Mum was pretty good with helping me find a therapist (this was almost 5 years after I first felt this way). She still sucks at understanding depression but there you go. Talking to friends is certainly an option, if they are your friends they won\u2019t see it as a burden and will probably understand a little. Just talking can help alleviate the feelings sometimes.\n\nNow, as a teacher of kiddos about your age I can safely say that in most countries schools can be very helpful! If you feel like you need to talk to someone you can check out if your school has a councillor. They can help with resources that may help (or even just listening). School nurses may also help, but if have never had anything to do with schools that have this resource so am unsure?\n\nAlso, most people with depression have it for \u201cno reason\u201d. People who have loved ones die etc \u201cfeel depressed\u201d they are not \u201cdepressed\u201d(a lot of the time). Grief has many of the same symptoms as depression but it eventually eases and has a clear starting point. Depression normally doesn\u2019t have a clear starting point and does not normally ease with time (aka you normally have to do something to help with your depression even if it is simply learn some coping mechanisms).\n\nSometimes we think we are depressed for logical reasons (I have a terrible personality, I don\u2019t have any friends, I suck at school, I suck at my job) but often these reasons are just the depression talking. Having a bad grade can make your depression worse, but less motivation is a symptom of depression and this often leads to thugs like worse grades.\n\nIf this continues or god forbid gets worse, please talk to someone you trust! Waiting five years to do anything is a load of bullshit!\n\nTLDR: you sound depressed, it could be a phase, but it could also be a serious health problem. There are people that can help!

Have you not been working, or do they owe you money? \n\nIt seems to me like maybe you care a little bit, enough to post anyway. It's okay for you to have support from outside your mom and bf. A lot of us here really understand. \n\nIf you're in the US and food is an issue, please call 211. I believe that number is for United Way. They can help you find a food pantry or get you information on how to apply for food stamps. \n\nWhat is one thing you can do today to make yourself feel better? Have you showered and gotten dressed to shoes today? It can be hard to face the day when we're unshowered and in our pajamas. Just doing some self-care can sometimes help a little bit anyway. Maybe you could go for a walk or listen to music that's calming. If the meds helped before, consider starting to take them again or reaching out to your doctor or therapist.\n\nWhen I get really down I end up laying on the couch all day without eating, showering or doing anything really. It doesn't help to move me out of that state. What helps is getting up and doing ONE thing that will have a positive impact on my life. Getting drunk or cutting does NOT count. It can be hygiene, exercise, healthy diet, drinking water, taking my meds, reaching out to my therapist, paying bills, washing dishes, following up on something for work (like missed pay), taking care of an obligation I've been avoiding, spending time with a caring friend, listening to positive upbeat music, etc. \n\nIt can be really easy to focus on what's going wrong, but can you think of a few things you're grateful for? It can be your boyfriend, or your physical health, or something beautiful in nature. Practicing mindful gratitude on a daily basis can help shift those negative feelings to more positive feelings, but it does take some effort. "

                "As always , a therapist is a very good place to start. I can never stress this enough as it's someone you can fully open up to that is impartial and unbiased. \n\nBut I have a feeling that your problems lie deeper. Everything you've stated suggests that you have a problem with love. I don't mean you have a commitment issue, or that you don't love your boyfriend, but that you may have issues that go beyond this.\n\nI guess i'll lead by example here and it may or may not pertain to you. I had an ex girlfriend that truly believed we were soulmates. She described everything as you have, yet she still was hiding little things, not fully opening up, and would very often project her problems onto me. \n\nI know it is very easy to THINK you are in love. Trust me, I am the same way. But are you honestly in LOVE. and please do not think that sex= love. Just because you are or are not in the mood for sex does not mean you are in or out of love, as these are very different things and you seem to be in this mindset that wanting or enjoying sex means you should or shouldn't love your significant other. \n\nEveryone is different of course so it is very hard for me to fully understand your situation from behind a computer, but it seems like your boyfriends sees sex as the end all be all and you have begun to see things his way. Again, you may also feel this way and I could be seeing things wrong. But much of your post is focused around sex. Which itself tells me that is how you gauge love interest.\nas always I will suggest seeing a therapist who specializes in talk therapy so you can just get whatever you don't feel comfortable talking about with your boyfriend off your chest and truly put all your cards on the table. From there it may be easier to see things.\n\nFrom my own point of view I would say it seems that you both are a bit immature (I don't mean this in a offensive way) and are stuck in this new age idea that lust = love. But I also don't know the rest of the details to your or his lives. \n\nI would really suggest you both see a therapist separately, and then find a couples therapist you are both comfortable with and go from there. \n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly with more information or comments back (depending on how much you would like to share on a public forum).\n\nRegardless I wish you both the best and thing a therapist (separately to start) would benefit you both."

On the other hand i know for a fact that the people i know care about me so its illogical to only look at the existential side of it.

I mean I eventually want to come off them but when I'm ready :) Doctors usually encourage you to undergo CBT treatment at the same time.   \n\n\nI also worried about side effects at first before I took them but then I realised whats the point? Maybe I waste my life or be dead if I didn't take them so I need them then I will take them and accept the side effects. After weighing it up it's definitely worth it.   \n\n\nI started taking Fluoexetine (Prozac) I think at first it did work but I eventually forgot to take it one day and just stopped and started taking it again but didn't work. I tried duloxetine (Cymbalta) also before this but it made me naseuous so I stopped. after a few days. I also tried Pristiq which worked for some time but then I don't think it did after a while (Maybe i should consulted my doctor and have increased my dose though). I tried Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few months or so but this LITERALLY didn't do anything.\n\nNow I take Venlafaxine (225mg) which is definitely working for me.

I worked at a pharmacy before and  can tell you all the antidepressents are sold on a regular basis. Everyones body reacts differently so try something if it doesn't work, or you have noticeable side effects that you don't like then just see your doctor and try another one. Sometimes you need to adjust your dose or be conscious of how its effecting/not effecting you. Realise its like a tool to help you function but not the permanant treatment itself :) Honestly try it though!

I didn't want to be on it when we were hoping to try to have a baby soon. I didn't want to experience horrible side effects that you can read in long lists from a quick search.\n\nBut I tried one. It was AWFUL. I was exhausted, out of it, forgetful, just in a weird state of mind. I couldn't feel negative emotions but I couldn't feel positive ones either. I didn't care about anything or want to do anything. We tried lowering the dose to see if it was just too much. That was no good.\n\nMy therapist told me that I shouldn't feel this way and shouldn't wait so long to call my doctor and ask about trying something else. So I called and switched to a different one over the course of a week or so. The transition was bad. I was doubtful it would do any good. But it takes time for bodies to adjust to new meds and in time it actual helped. I can feel emotions. I don't cry randomly for no reason as much (mostly just when super stressed). I am doing much better, more functional, more interested in activities, etc. I am not \"cured\" or \"healed\" but I am better able to cope with my depression and anxiety. I'm glad I stuck to it and got to where I am now. It was a horrible start but worth it.\n\nI hope you can find something that works for you but don't give up on the first thing you try or the first few weeks on something. It felt like it would be forever before something would even be working and I didn't think I could wait that long but looking back from this side of it, I'm glad I pushed through.

Other symptoms you might experience: lack of motivation, lower self-esteem, bad coping strategies, thoughts that start a negative feedback loop etc.\n\nSecondly, you need to search in your history for the reason what caused your behaviour. That can be even as simple as moving to another place and leaving a lot of friends behind. Most teenagers start to feel better as they mature, so a depression caused by puberty is probably out of the question and even then suicidal thoughts are invoked by (minior) events such as breakups etc.\n\nWhen you found out what caused this mess, you need to start cleaning up. Reflect on your feelings and on your behavior. Reduce stress and try to routine your day (which you probably dont have to since you're in the military).

You might discount the compliment and say, oh, you\u2019re just being nice. You don\u2019t mean that. \n\nHere\u2019s where the practice comes in. Just. Say. Thank you. \n\nA friend feels all of her attempts at art are shit. Others don\u2019t feel that way and say nice things. I am coaching her to say, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d There\u2019s no need to point out the flaws, which she and I tend to do. Just. Say. Thank you. Eventually, the artist comes to appreciate her/his own work. \n\nThis really works, but it works slowly, subtly. You don\u2019t even see it happening. Practice. \n\nThis example may not apply to you. Maybe you can practice not caring what others think. Wear something you like, but something others probably won\u2019t. Keep telling yourself you don\u2019t care and, really, it doesn\u2019t matter if nobody likes it. \n\nFrom my own story, I made a dress/tunic out of a variety of repurposed fabric. Foolishly, I asked my straight-laced, critical sister if she liked it. She said she didn\u2019t. It hurt. It shouldn\u2019t have because who gives a fuck what she thinks? I realized that she embodies my inner critic and has for all my life. Well, I fired her from that post. I\u2019m practicing to carry on doing what I like. It\u2019s a work in progress. \n\nChanging the way you think is so hard but it can be done. \n\nSo much good luck to you. I\u2019m rooting for you. \n\nBTW can you and the other poster play video games online, talking to each other, and what not? Like my nephew does? "

                "Talking helps if its the right people. When I hit complete rock bottom and finally (after about 8 years) decided to get professional help I told one of my closest friends. I knew that friend good enough to know he won't freak out about it and it helped me to go through with therapy and medication. Once you realise how much it helps to tell someone it gets \"easier\" but you still got to choose wise.\n\nI wouldn't tell co-workers or so as unfortunately mankind hasn't reached that point of acceptance yet and I don't want to make things awkward. There are still many people out there who think you might not be able to perform well or whatever they think. They just have no idea.\n\nBut telling close friends is really important I think. Even just one person where you can offload stuff. I have a friend who is great in listening and then he worries that he can't really help... I keep telling him that getting it out is all I need (from him). \n\nThe same with when people are asking \"How are you?\", the global standard answer is \"I'm fine\" no matter what is going on with a person. Having that friend you can't tell you having a shit day (depression related) is so important.\n\nIf I wouldn't have told any friends about it I wouldn't be here anymore.\n\nAnd NEVER EVER be afraid or ashamed to get professional help. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.",
                "In my personal experience, it really depends on the person. I'd also recommend, if you're feeling pretty bad (and suspect you'll be in that stage for a while) talk first and mostly to a therapist, ideally weekly (monthly or even biweekly can feel like such a long time depending on your level of depression). See if your uni has options for that, or see if you can find a low-income option in your area (in my area we have a couple that have \"sliding scale\" fees. (aka you pay just what you can afford)\n\nI told very certain people about it years after it (About 4-5), when i finally started being able to (barely) pull myself together. This is because it can be extremely hard to open up at all, and when you're at your worst, if they react in a way you were not hoping (immediately or otherwise, some people got my hopes up only to disappear from my life later) it can be particularly hard when you're in a bad stage of your depression.\n\nYou also have to check yourself to not use the people that you told them about as therapists. There's only so much \"negative talk\" they can handle, so usually you have to be really conscious about either switching the focus on them, or have some happy tale ready to \"counter\" your depression talk (if you have any, otherwise you gotta be ready to also listen to them, which can be hard depending on the mental state you are).\n\nRemember that friends/family are not trained/equipped to deal with major illnesses, they're not professionals or doctors. They most probably won't be able to handle it properly, or say the things you need to hear. And knowing that won't take the sting off their actions either, regardless of well intentions or not.\n\nI know it sounds a bit depressing (haha) but as of right now I'd highly recommend a therapist above any friends. The sooner, the better. Talking about it with a professional means that the entire allotted time will be dedicated to only you, who will be neutral, keep you on the path of treatment and you will have a good constant on your routine. You can go with a plan on what to talk, or just go and ask your therapist to help you with leading questions.",

I'm not planning on telling anyone what exactly is bothering me, only make them aware that I'm having a hard time. ",

They wonder if they should be more careful around you or they try to be \"too\" \"normal\" around you or they try to avoid you because they don't know how to deal with it. I want to be treated like everyone else and not differently but you can't expect that from everyone if they know. \n\nIf I have a shitty day and a \"stranger\" asks me how I am I just tell them I'm fine but if a friend who knows asked me then I am likely to have a little meltdown right there... I can't expect every random person to be able to deal with that.

However, it doesn't really matter if you have diagnosable depression or not, what matters is that you're feeling the way you are and it's harming you, and you would like to feel better. \n\nThere are plenty of home therapies and recovery strategies for depression that you can do by yourself at home, I'd suggest following those and other depression-related advice anyways, as the symptoms you describe do seem like at least mild depression. One Google search can find you plenty to go off of (I apologise for not being able to link anything right now, I'm on mobile and pressed for time).\n\nFor now, treat it like it is depression, because even if it's not, recovery strategies should still provide much relief. If you're so inclined, do talk to a professional later, especially if you've been trying self-help for a while and nothing seems to be working. Contrary to what some might say, antidepressants can actually be a godsend for some to rid them of those pesky chemical imbalances. Therapy is another option that can be particularly effective as well. There's no one-size-fits-all cure, as everyone's depression will be different, but a professional can at least give you an informed opinion on where to start on the road to recovery. You have everyone here as well, and may ask as many questions as you please.\n\nSorry once again that I can't get into more specifics, I don't have much time as I'm writing this but I did want to make sure you had at least some cursory insight.

When everything is going just fine and you're still depressed, that's likely a chemical imbalance. That's the kind of depression that requires medication. But when external factors, such as what you're going through, are causing the depression, you may want to try seeing a therapist before trying any meds. Talking to a therapist feels weird at first but when I found one that I really \"clicked\" with, it started feeling more like talking to a best friend. They can help you create a plan to stay sane and healthy while you tackle everything that's happening. I hate that emotions are so taboo for men; it's part of being human. And with you going through so much, I'd be surprised and concerned if you weren't feeling this way. What you're feeling is just a sign that you're human and not a sociopath. (Have you ever met one??

I'd say no.\n\nYou tried your best and you failed. I tried my best and failed. I tried to so many places and failed. Does it mean I'm more flawed than you ? Should I therefore defenestrate myself ? \n\nNo my dear. And you should not end yourself. \n\nI quote, a post that I copied to my clipboard, from local forums. To clarify, NUS and NTU are the universities in Singapore with medical schools.\n\n\"If you are really keen on doing medicine after the rejection, there are ways to do it such as doing it overseas or post-grad. But like what someone has said above, doing medicine is overrated and just because you got rejected from nus/ntu eventually doesn't mean that you are not good enough to do medicine; it's just the way things are.\u00a0\n\nIf you can't afford studying overseas, then suck it up and do something else first and if you still want to pursue it, you can surely do it the post-grad way after working a few years.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would like to stress that rejection from nus/ntu doesn't mean that you are not cut out to be a doctor but think hard about whether the long medical training inclusive of undergrad and postgrad is worth the time and effort or not.\n\nAgreed, please don't think that you are no good just because you got rejected from these schools because to be honest, it is very difficult for the admissions committee to tell if someone is really suited for medicine or not just from a few rounds of interviews/MMI/\"psycho-analysis\". Tonnes of people that were made for medicine were rejected in the years before you and conversely tonnes of people whom\n are not cut out to be doctors got in.\u00a0\"\n\nThank you for taking time to read this. Because I feel your pain, I really hope that you can stay strong. It's not easy. It's going to be living hell. But at least when you are alive you got a chance to make it right. \n"

I know this because someone who I was with about two years ago (I don't know whether he was or wasn't depressed) lied about the small things and the big things (i.e. his birthday, his age, his job etc) and I just left him but I loved him, I mean it was love at first site on both parts. But lying was a big deal-breaker for me because if a person is lying then trust fades. I also think that you should try and change the way that you are because she will leave and if she came back again after she left and you hadn't changed then she would be forever one out of your life. I would say, sit down with her and discuss what you both want from this relationship in order for it to work (she wants honesty but what do you want?) and then try to let her know just how bad you are feeling inside and let her hug you x. As for your parents, I had that growing up to. I wasn't allowed to cry as I would get hit for it and then low and behold I wouldn't be able to stop crying beyond a certain point (it was scary) but I'm one of the most loyal girls along with a few of my friends that I know of and so I suppose that you just have to work on yourself there (it isn't easy and I still rarely cry infant of people but I do sometime shut people and I do sometimes let people know how I feel even if it's awkward or I just don't want to for fear of worrying them, and you'd be surprised about the amount of people who will actually talk about it seriously with you x).

This can take time, but stick with it; it's worth it in the end. I didn't find a good one until a year ago. It can really make a difference. \n\n3. Download a free app that is based upon cognitive behavioral therapy  (CBT). I use CBT Diary, but I have tried others and most of them seem useful. Cognitive behavioral therapy will help you correct irrational thinking. Your brain is marble, and you can sculpt it to your liking  (seriously). Especially now, before your brain finishes developing, which it will do somewhere around your 25th birthday. \n\n4. *Sometimes* some people occasionally require medication. This is a decision that is between you and your doctor. Take their opinions to heart. They were trained to help you make a sound decision.\n\n5. Follow your dream. You might have to work shit jobs while you make it happen, but don't let go of your dreams. Wake up earlier. Don't stay up later, your brain needs sleep. But don't give up on your dream. Make it your real vocation; your day job is your side gig.\n\n6. Face your fear of upsetting your mother. Your therapist will help you to this end.\n\n7. Believe in yourself. I know as well as anyone how difficult that can be, but if you don't believe in yourself, how can anyone else? This is a good one where I find the adage \"Fake it til you make it\" to actually be legit advice. The more confident you act, the more confident you will be perceived to be,  and the more confident you will feel. Your therapist will also help you with this.\n\nI spent the entirety of my teens and twenties feeling exactly the same way you do. I have learned all of the advice I just gave you the hard way. I got in my way so hard. I made excuses, and when I couldn't believe those anymore, I found real reasons not to do what my heart most desired. My family needed me. I had anxiety and depression and ptsd. I was suicidal.\n\nBut there will ALWAYS be something. We have to learn to prioritize. If you can't make time for it, it can't be that important to you. We have to learn to work through the pain, because otherwise, what else is there to do? Suffer? But why do that when you can just write about suffering, draw a picture, write a song, whatever it is you do. The more Resistance you feel toward living your dream, the more important it is that you accomplish it.\n\nGood luck! Remember, success is 1/3 luck, 1/3 talent, and 1/3 who you know.

Trust me i do.\nI\u2019m sorry, but I think people are very unpredictable, and you need to open with yourself and let yourself be your friend.\nI know this is hard. But I think it might help. (I really hope it does).\nI am not pretending I know your struggle, because I don\u2019t. Heck, I never will, no one ever will except you.\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m putting it in the wrong way, but everyone isn\u2019t with you as you are with yourself, therefore, time isn\u2019t enough for one to know you as you know yourself.\nPlease know that they don\u2019t know and they didn\u2019t when they said that you\u2019re doing that for attention, and to add on that, it\u2019s people, heck, they ruin everything.\n\nAlso, from now on, I\u2019d like you to know also that looking for attention isn\u2019t something you should be ashamed for. \nAttention is a need, it\u2019s a need for everyone. It\u2019s a fact. It\u2019s just that some people need more or less. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m sorry in the name of everyone that we didn\u2019t do anything for you, i\u2019m sorry that we never let you be. I am terribly sorry.\n\nI want to help, but it really seems that I can\u2019t. So instead, i\u2019d like you to give one advice, that i wish i knew earlier. \n\nPlease keep looking for attention if you think you need or want it. It\u2019s not wrong.\nBut do it in the right way. \nPlease get to know people before you tell them for your situation. Because only those who experience it want to help and know what you mean. \nDo it in front of people you\u2019re sure are serious, like this community here, and try to explain it in a way that\u2019ll make the other know that you\u2019re being serious, and it\u2019s not an illusion or something you\u2019re just making up. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long reply and for not helping, i did my best, and I wouldn\u2019t comment because I knew from the beginning that I won\u2019t help, but since there wasn\u2019t any other comments, i just wanted to let you know that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nPlease feel free to talk to me, and i\u2019m pretty sure that others too here might want to help. I know it\u2019s hard to talk about it, i know. \nBut please don\u2019t stop trying, I don\u2019t know if you will ever make it out, but if you won\u2019t try. I am Sure you won\u2019t. \nWe, as humans suck &amp; life gets unbearable. I know that. But there are people who make life bearable, live to meet them. Be one. I believe in you.",

I know that I need to be able to open up with myself and love myself and do things for myself as well as help others and that might help me. And I think that last part or two was really helpful, knowing that I won't make it out if I don't try that it will be definite but at least if I try there is a chance, and the part about living to meet the people who make it bearable is also reassuring and helpful, so thank you. The last thing I didn't take into consideration is that I can't expect everyone to know how I'm feeling especially if I don't open up and that I should open up to people I trust and who want to help.

                "I guess I can relate a bit to you. I'm 22 now, but when I was younger, even younger than you, I had suffered bullying a lot because I was a nerd, weird and well, kids called me ugly a lot. I had a big problem with acne, wore glasses and braces, so yeah. Definitely not the most popular kid. Also didn't had much friends, was too shy and scared of talking to people, as I always felt that I would say the wrong thing and be awkward. Things did get better as I grow up, specially in college, when I learned some social skills and become a bit more confident in myself.  \nI don't know if it will help, but as I was reading your post, I remembered something a guy told me once. He was also depressed, but the reason why he wouldn't give up on his life was not cause he was positive, but because he \"wanted to bet on it\" (I don't really know how to translate the correct expression to english, english is not my original language lol hope it's correct). He was 28 and still felt young, he thought it was worth seeing where life would lead him. And, in a way, I guess I agree with him. It also remembers me of something I read on this subreddit, it was someone saying that death is a certain and definitive thing, but life is not. \nWhat I'm trying to say is, you never know how your future may turn out to be. When I was being bullied and sad, I thought of dying and really wished to die. But now that I look back, I guess it would be really sad, because I would miss a lot of important and big experiences that happened later. Don't get me wrong, I am depressed, still. But I feel happy when I remember the friends I made along the way, the guys I fell in love with, the great conversations I had, the new things I tried. These are things I really treasure. You're so young, you know, so maybe stick around here for more time. Depression is tough, people can disappoint you, but there might be one or two things that make life worth.\nI hope you find a way of dealing better with your pain and problems. My way was looking for a therapist and I'll also see a psychiatrist next week. Don't feel bad about being anxious cause of psychiatrists, I also tried to avoid as much as possible, I was very scared of trying meds. Maybe it'll take a while before you get the courage as well, maybe you will find another type of treatment. I really hope my comment helps, best of wishes",
                "I'm sorry you went through so much, but I am glad you have found people and things that have made the fight worth it. Your comment helps and I guess you are right in saying that there is so much I will miss if I die and that I have to stay alive to see the things that make it worth living and to just see how life turns out. I am also glad that you say it is normal to be anxious to see a psychiatrist at first and it will take time, because I know other people feel this and have to get overcome it too, but once they do it gets better. And I too hope I find a way but now am I going to start looking and not rejecting the help I am offered because I missed so many opportunities. Thank you for sharing, it does help.",

                "Hey, don't worry about it.  Thanks for reaching out.\n\nHonestly, we can't tell you if you're depressed.  What you are experiencing sounds quite typical, to be honest.  I don't mean to belittle your experience, instead I want just to show that you aren't alone.  People experience this lack of motivation in various parts of their lives, for varying reasons.  Your case is unique, especially because it is happening to you.  But you also, are not alone.\n\nSo, you have some reasons to be stressed.  School isn't the perfect environment for you to thrive, but you seem to enjoy being a drummer.  (sorry, I'm not familiar with the British? school system)  You... procrastinate.  That is... human.  Your subconscious (let's call it that) would rather distract you than experience the pain of dealing with your stress head on.  This is a defense mechanism.  But it's also a mechanism that is making things worse.  You have acknowledged that as well.\n\nMy first piece of advice to you, is Don't Do It Alone!  It's the first step you can take.  Start your work when you are at school.  You might be embarrassed at first, but in the long run it will be good for you.  We can't avoid embarrassing things forever, well you could, but some of the best things in life come from us embarrassing ourselves over and over again (love, for example).  If you start your work at school, you won't be able to stare off into your screen.  You will be closer to your teachers and they will be more willing to help you.  Or ask somebody to study with you.  You will get rejected and you will get embarrassed, but goddammit try it again until you work something out.  The social factor keeps you from becoming a shut in and letting your waffle lizard brain decide what to do.\n\nNext...  introduce some structure into your life.  Why do nuns pray?  Is it to worship?  To purify their souls?  No, it's because the prayer bell rang.  Making decisions takes willpower, and when you are fighting depression and procrastination willpower is limited.  What structure does is it lets you delegate the decision making to the schedule.  You have a certain amount of time each day, at a certain place, you are doing your work.  And you make it sacred.  Something you do according the schedule.  Terry Crews used this technique, he has a schedule to go to the gym.  If he had a terrible day, he still goes to the gym.  He might not work out while he's there, but at least he always goes.  So it's never a fight to be there, he just is.  And look how jacked the man is.  So, maybe you have a study buddy now, maybe not, but you have a time you go to the library and you work.  Maybe choose the computer spot where everybody walking by can see what you're working on, so you aren't tempted to waste time.  But if you do, hey, you're at the library brainiac, pick up a book.\n\nOther things to consider:  Novelty (going someplace new to work), energy (are you eating and sleeping right?), control (is your life absolutely crazy?).  A therapist could help you stick with a behavioral program like the above, help you learn the skills you need to be the person you want to be.  It's not your fault you don't know them yet, in fact I'm impressed you are asking for help rather than burying your head in the sand.  And, then, the behavioral approach isn't enough, then maybe you have a neurological issue (depression or ADHD?) and you need a medical boost.  And even then, the medicine works much better with behavioral accountability.  Otherwise with depression you're miserable with your mood enhanced, or with ADHD you're suddenly really focused at doing things that don't help you.\n\nDoes that help a little?"

I think stating that \"I'm depressed\" gives you a sense of closure.\n\nSo by all means, if you think you're depressed, you may as well be depressed. Please don't let it get the best of you, though.\n\nPersonally, I don't seek attention at all. I just tell myself I'm depressed as a way to describe my constant state of being lonely, having zero motivation, and not wanting to exist, but sticking in there for some reason.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if you diagnose yourself as depressed, make it mean something to you. Find the help you need, a community, and support. I found someone near me (they're technically a therapist), and they've really helped me.\n\n(Side note that you can always get yourself diagnosed by a professional, but keep in mind that some doctors can be wack.)",
                "For me, I felt similarly until I realized that most people *don\u2019t want to die*. Even though you don\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it, I\u2019m assuming you still really wish you could. I needed this realization to be able to see my situation objectively: that people who legitimately want to die for an extended period of time need help and therefore I should probably get help. \nAlso, it seems that your thinking on this is a bit distorted: yes many people of our age group talk about how they want to die and such. But I think for a lot of them, it\u2019s just because they\u2019re in a tough situation, which is reasonable. But if you\u2019re feeling this way, like, most of the time, and not just when you\u2019re going through a temporarily rough time, yes I\u2019d guess that you have something deeper going on. Especially because you want a bit of a push to get yourself to do it- I feel the same way pretty often. I think I was in your situation not too long ago, so feel free to pm me if you have more questions, or just want to talk :)",
                "In my experience if you think you might be doing/feeling something for attention and feel guilty about it, that means that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a sort of internalized defense mechanism maybe? Like, I\u2019m not actually feeling this I just need attention therefore everything is fine and I\u2019m fine I just need to get over it, sort of attitude. Take a second to acknowledge how you feel and validate it. Honestly, with depression, recognizing you\u2019re emotions is a really good step. ",
                "So do you sometimes feel ok? Temporarily? Maybe when you\u2019re distracted, just got good news, or something like that? Or should it be most of the time to be classified as depression? I don\u2019t know why I want to give what I feel a name, maybe because if everyone really does feel like this but not everyone reacts the way I do that means I\u2019m just weak. And btw thanks for seeming to care about me more than my friends do I really appreciate it.",
                "It\u2019s sort of hard to say, because every depressive episode I\u2019ve had that I can remember has felt slightly different. Like a lot of the time, yeah, if I\u2019m distracted by my friends, I feel okay and not really be thinking about dying or whatever. It would just be when I was alone or in my head a lot when I would feel really badly.\n\nBut then also, quite recently, for me it\u2019s changed a bit so that even when I feel sort of good in a way, the weight of the feeling would still be very noticeable in the background, so it\u2019s just 24/7. But normally the answer would be yes: distractions would definitely make me feel alright.\n\nA question that you may want to ask yourself is: if you look back at the past couple weeks or so, has this feeling truly affected your quality of life? Has it affected the decisions you make, and how you interact with the people around you? If the answer is yes, (which from what I\u2019ve read about you it seems to me it is,) then it\u2018s very likely that it\u2019s an issue that deserves to be treated in some way.\n\nAnd yeah, I understand the feeling of wanting to know whether or not to classify it as depression. I suppose being diagnosed proves that, it really is a disease that can be treated, rather than just your personality that you have to live with.\n\nNo problem :) a few redditors have given me a great deal of help when I was still in your position, so I\u2019m more than happy to pass on the good deed.

                "Alright, So I see you're going through a lot of problems, and they will each take some work to get through. Let's start with, I am also failing uni right now. So, first things first, you need to talk with a school advisor and let them know what you are going through, how school is going right now for you, and that you don't want to be doing this, but you're having problems (I also need to do this right now). I get just trying to work on happiness but then the anxiety of not dealing with it and it isn't going to get better without dealing with it. Time to put on our big people pants (and I'm not trying to be condescending I need to do the exact same thing). You need to tell them so then they can start to work with you on how to maybe not screw up royally and see what you can do about this semester. They may or may not recommend you to a school counselor who may be able to help you with the emotional problems you are having. Maybe there is a university clinic where you can see a doctor. They may give you something to help with your symptoms, anxiety, inability to sleep, etc. This is only a band aid, temporarily making it easier to cope however. The reasons you are having these problems need to be dealt with. If you can't talk to a counselor to unload your issues, do you have a friend you are closest with out of your friends? I know men are supposed to be \"strong, don't cry, not have emotional issues and struggles like this, and if you are, you absolutely can not talk about it!\" Unfortunately, this is the toxic masculinity of our culture that causes men to not deal with their emotional issues and discuss it with their male friends. Sometimes you'd be surprised what happens when you bring something like this up with your friends. Some are likely to be having the same issues, they just don't talk about it. It's up to you if you want to start that conversation though, and who with. Maybe a sibling if you have one? Another option might be to go to the library and get some books related to the issues you are having. Brene Brown's, Daring Greatly might be an option. And something related to anxiety and/or depression. Reading might be a good place to start if you'd rather not voice it to others at the moment. A huge thing when people get to college, is after a while they start comparing themselves to their peers, socially, and academically. It is not a good thing to do, speaking from experience. You have to try hard and learn to not compare yourself to others but rather attempt to become a better you. Focusing on yourself, and increasing self-esteem/self-confidence is way more important. Fuck others accomplishments when you're trying to work on your own. You do you whatever way is right for you. Know for me it took years to achieve, but it's something important to do. I can't really say much about the relationship and weed stuff you mention. I don't have experience with weed, although alcohol is something I've used to numb myself it the past. Of course it's not good, you're not facing your problems. But I understand just trying to cope with life in the moment. Having a short goal to look for in the future and work towards might be something. Pick one goal that is something you need and want, and is a short term goal for bettering yourself in the moment, and focus on getting to that point. I know you don't want to hear this but sex is not the be all end all. Don't get me wrong, it's great, and it definitely makes me lose focus sometimes and not allow me to concentrate without it, however, you don't have to compete with people, and you don't have to be a member of the no fap group. Take care of yourself, you know? Also, it's healthy for you, science says, so.. there. And maybe get some reading on being codependent? Not saying you are, I don't know anything about you, just coming up with ideas. I hope at least one thing I've said might help if what I've said is all a bunch of malarkey. Good luck with everything, I hope you can turn things around soon. Wishing the best for you.",

I also write about this stuff on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Banip-qHksY/).\n\nThe BIGGEST problem with mental struggles is they convince us that everything we think and feel is true. There's a difference between thoughts and feelings being REAL, and thoughts and feelings being TRUTH. A lot of the reason people are defeated by these issues is because they don't know how to distinguish between the two. So when a thought or feeling says something negative in a matter-of-fact tone, \"You're worthless\" or \"You'll never be successful!\", the person immediately, even if just for a split second, accepts that as **truth**. Then a downward spiral and wicked cycle of sadness, anxiety and complete loss of identity has free reign to trample us because in our agreement we've given it permission. Oh, it'll sometimes let up, giving us just enough of a break to think it's left for good and we're \"over it,\" then, like the wicked devil it is, it comes back even worse than the time before, making us feel afraid to have hope of being \"cured\" because every time we think we are, there it is to prove us wrong.\n\nFUCK THAT THING.\n\nThe way to kick its ass is to learn who you are, then stick to that with a stubborn and obnoxious insistence. To everyone else you might sometimes seem to border on the line of denial. \"Are you blind? Look around!\" But you're not living by outside opinions of inside feelings, you're learning to live on that truth of identity established deeper than any of it. Setting that solid foundation is KEY if you don't want this thing to keep taking wins over you.\n\nI exist to help people in your situation get that kind of foundation established, so I hope you'll take a bit to go through and read some of what I've written!"

So we're both fucked up haha. \n\nSomething that helps is for her to talk to her. Sometimes you don't even need to have a conversation but talk to her as if you're talking to yourself. One, this will help her understand what is going through your head, and two, it can help you loosen up and get it out of your system, at least for a little bit.

They have helped when I allowed it. I just get so distracted with my thoughts sometimes that it doesn't always work and I feel so bad for them while it happens.\n\nI never turned to drugs or any substances, I have only taken herbal antidepressants for a short period of time but didn't trust that it really worked.\n\nTalking to someone is one of the most positive ways to cope. Maybe I just constantly need the reminder that there are people out there that are going through it and continue to look for long term solutions. I also could have multiple personality disorder but it's so hard to prove it to a doctor when you can't exactly make it happen. Like a girl with rapid mood swings except I am a young male.\n\nThey just say that I was traumatised at a young age but I have no memory of ever being traumatised for it to develop, I have never been domestically abused or bullied too much at school but i seem to always have this social anxiety.. and it caused be to be the way I am now.\n\nI don't expect anyone to hold my hand through it all because it's a big burden.

I know it's not easy when you feel like you have no energy and would just prefer sleeping, but it becomes easier over time and has totally been worth the initial struggle for me."

                "It definitely could be a disorder. Loss of interest can be from depression. I'm a 24 year old male and I have severe depression. It was crippling not so long ago. I am a capable person, I can see what needs to be done to get what I want, and I know the effort it would take to get it, but sometimes my life energy is just sapped away. For me it's like the first snag and I feel like a failure. Even if it's not bad. I can succeed at a task but not do as well as I wanted and feel terrible. \n\nI also tend to have the same feelings about it being my problem and I need to fix it. It's easy to feel like I've let out my disorder and negatively impacted someone's day, it's really easy to spiral myself with those thoughts. Worst part is my mind is often clouded from my depression, I imagine the bad scenarios and ignore the good. Opposite of rose colored glasses. If that makes sense.\n\nDisorder or not, talking about your feelings is good for you. It can relieve a lot of stress. I'm here to listen man. I will help how I can, I have lots of anecdotes from my life, I can also share how I cope if your interested, or really anything you want to talk about.\n\nOh, it might not be a bad idea to post in a relationship help forum too, looking  at the situation from multiple angles couldn't hurt.",
                "Well as of today I feel a lot stronger than yesterday, I started to organize my thoughts, started writing down my red flags (what happens before I start overreacting) and honestly that little bit I feel like I have control of myself. Im trying not to get too ahead of myself at the same time, I dont want to take on too much at once. I find a major contributor is that I tend to look towards people feeling compassion towards me, and sometimes I tend to do things or say things to overreact and make the situation worse (like a guilt trip) so I can feel that compassion.\n\nAnyways sorry for the ramble I would like to hear a little what helped you in a similar situation or experience, if you dont mind! Thank you very much!",
                "Well it sounds like you are on the right track. Organizing thoughts and not taking on too much is a part of what my therapist has me for treatment. Mindfulness is the what seems to be helping me the most. Noticing when I'm feeling down so that I can give it the space and the respect it deserves, that feeling is still a part of me after all. Mindfulness also has a goal of noticing when the good feelings arise, to appreciate them and live in them as long as possible, while excepting that I will be sad again eventually, and that's ok. If that sounds as similar to what you are trying to do I have some techniques to practice it. Like holding an ice cube in you hand and letting it melt, but set your focus on anything other than the ice cube. Another one is to put a piece of chocolate or any melty candy on your tongue, focus on it melting, but don't bite it. Those are some things you can practice that can also help with feeling some control in your life.\n\nStory time. It's more of a cautionary tale then a direct relationship to your events. When I was young life wasn't always good, I was a boy so crying wasn't acceptable, and anger made situations worse. I just put on a smile and pushed negative feelings away. Feelings need to be released. They build up and I can imagine you've felt that. For me, I wouldn't  let them out as emotion, so they came out as vomit. I would through up about once a day from elementary school to high school. No one knew, I felt it was a weakness and kept it in. My body got used to it, and it did work. People thought I had myself together, I was a teen mentor and a tutor, had no trouble speaking to large groups. One day when I was 21 things just changed, the vomiting feeling wouldn't go away after vomiting it made it really difficult  to do anything. I ended up dropping weight, from about 135 to 100lbs before I got help. Been slow and not always steady progress back from then on. The feeling I have can easily transition to anger for some people.\n\nAs it applies to my relationships, it's just too hard right now for me. I feel like such a burden and that I can't offer enough to woman I care about. It's a story I can't get past even though I know it isn't real. I can find ways to be caring and helpful, that part of me never left, even if it is hard to for me to see. Some girls are attracted to me because of my flaws, I shouldn't feel like a burden to them, but here I feel guilty like I tricked them or something. Point of this one is depression clouds the mind, and makes you believe and do things that the logical part of you knows makes no sense.\n\nYou don't have to worry about rambling on man. Anything you want to say to me I want to hear. Hope you continue feeling strong. I'm here if you want to talk more.",
                "Same to you man, i'm here to listen if you need to talk! I'm glad that you are getting the help you need and that you are accepting everything well! I know that once you find yourself out, you will find the right relationship too! I wouldn't worry about not being in one cause in your shoes currently, you can probably grow more being single until you find your right place. Everything will work out man, for me and for you. Just a matter of time! Again thank you for the kind words and advice :) Ill definitely be referring back to this if I feel out of control or lost again!!!! Good luck in all!!!",

Idk what is wrong but I looked at BPD also. No idea how to fix myself.  It all feels so real when it happens and then I'm like, wtf, why was it such a big Deal? Sorry, man. I wish you the best. ",
                "That's exactly how I have been. I hope you are able to find out how to defeat it! Im only 2 days in, trying not to get my hopes up but its starting to look better. For me it was just a change in mindset, I have a really hard time accepting that I did something wrong sometimes and even when i told myself I did it my mind actually thought I was wrong, Overcoming that was the biggest help for me! Good luck to you, and i'm always here to listen if you need."

I also like to feel productive but my mental health set me back massively. If you really are a workaholic try volunteering. It'll boost your CV as well as making it look really good, I mean, who works for fun? You could also try for an apprenticeship, and remember that you can be in receipt of housing benefit if you struggle to pay rent and council tax, even if you're earning.\n\nI don't have BiPolar but I have a condition not to dissimilar (Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). I promise you the doctor is trying for a referral however the NHS is really underfunded when it comes to mental health and it will take a long time. (I'm the same as you and waiting for my therapy to start, however it may be sent onwards to a non-profit organisation). It may be an idea to be put on medication if that's something you feel comfortable doing too as it will probably help you.\n\nIf your finding it all too much try getting in touch with the samaritans or mind. You also said you do art, use this frustration and plug it straight into the art and create something fantastic. I know you said you don't have a following but there's no reason you cant start something on reddit if you try. I know some Depression/anxiety subreddits encourage people sharing work. For instance I'm thinking of possibly starting a youtube channel of my stories of mental health, what I understand about conditions, misconceptions, and maybe throw in some comedy in there to to brighten it up in the hope that other people can find comfort in it. (Like you, wouldn't have any publicity and it would probably just flop though)\n\nHope I helped",
                "Yes, I am British.\nI recieve \u00a3200 towards rent and \u00a3245 in help. Rent takes \u00a3400.\nMy last job was an apprenticeship but they couldn't pay me more. I am 20, and was working at \u00a33.30/hour. Which reduced my benefit help despite the low wage, they gave me \u00a340 and took most of it due to earnings. \u00a3500 with \u00a320 left after rent and tax. \nUnfortunately there is no where to volunteer around here (I live in a very rural area) and I have no transport. I would love to volunteer with animals.\n\nI have sleeping meds but I react bad to the others. Nightmares and worsened hallucinations etc.\nThe organisation they are referring me to is non profit, they seem ok. Its just waiting for the appointment to come through.\n\nI have done a few pieces. I decided to do some based on happy memories so they made me happy when I saw them. But I dont know what to do with them. I want to do panda cartoons and cat stuff and maybe create prints or teeshirts. Something I know people would maybe be interested in maybe. It is just setting myself up. I always wanted to sell art work to people who would appreciate it.\n\nIf you start a youtube channel, drop me a link if thats ok? I would love to see your content. I think it is good more people strive to make more people aware of mental health issues and dispell the stigmas.\n\nI hope it doesnt seem like I shot down your suggestions to me, I just wanted to reply honestly. My situation is just meh.\nYou have however inspired me to draw a new piece involving stars and clouds, so thank you &lt;3\nI dont know if I should work on it tonight or tomorrow...\n\nThank you for your response. I hope my reply makes sense. I feel kind of dopey at the moment ^^\"",

I've moved to Southampton and it feels like nothing's here despite it being still being a city.\n\nYou never know what's in the area. Check out Doit.org as there may be stuff in your area. Also if you're over 18 they have to pay you more after the first year in an apprenticeship.\n\nHave you mentioned the side affects of pills to your doctor? I have never heard of hallucinations as a side affect. Anti-psych meds could help with that and if you're not seeing a therapist then your doctor's basically letting you go untreated which is not ok. \n\nYou could make novelty T-shirts and sell them online through your own store or someone else's. The internet's a great place I'm sure you could find someone who has a t-shirt store or someone who can make them and sell the designs. Starting a small business would keep you occupied too.\n\nAnother idea is selling them as prints and get a deal with an online canvas printer. I've been tempted to do that with my photography. Plus it'll give you a real confidence boost\n\nAs for my YouTube plan, I have no idea what content I'd include and don't even have a good camera or mic. I wouldn't want to make it all doom and gloom either; letsplays could be good but I'm nowhere good enough at games yet.\n\nI'd like to see the new piece when it's done, sounds really cool. "

Once you hit your middle 20's, it stops becoming much of a problem, but you're not even 18 yet and you're dating a fully fledged adult. However, I'll leave that to one side for now. \n\nLook, if you're asking Reddit for help, there's a problem. And it's not a problem that's minor, if you really had to come here and ask us for help. It's a big, big problem by this point, and it's obviously effecting you immensely. My best advice for you is to break up. Once it hits this point, it's too far gone. You see, when I was with my ex, I was like you. I didn't wanna let her go, but we fought almost daily. She would /always/ bring up past fights like he's doing, and it hurt me. She would hold grudges for weeks, maybe even months. I realised I wasn't happy with her, and she was hurting me more than she was making me happy. \n\nYou realised he was doing that, but got back together because you were scared. I understand, but that was the wrong thing to do. Please, please listen to yourself. Don't be with him because you're scared to be alone, be with someone because you truly believe they're the one and you're happy with them. Don't settle for mediocrity, or unhappiness, which seems to be the case here. Only you can make this decision, but I'm sure the people here, and I definitely will, help you do it. But my best advice is to end it. Don't be scared of being alone, do it for your sake and your happiness. \n\nEdit: and don't ever be with someone just because they have problems and you wanna help. I have depression so I know how it feels, but people shouldn't date me out of pity and wanting to help. They shouldn't be scared that person will kill themselves if they leave. A girl did that to me many years ago (which is one of the reasons I have depression) and it destroyed me. She was one of the worst people I've ever known, and she would continuously use her want for suicide to get things and to keep me with her. Don't let that dictate your decision. Do something because you want it, not for how it effects the other. Also that's one huge sum of money he stole (yes, he's stolen it) from you. That's absolutely unjustifiable. Please realise this man isn't a nice man and leave him. Not only for your sake, but then he might actually sort his life out.

My heart still hurts so much and idk what to do. I'm regretting leaving him, all alone when he needs me the most, as I felt that way the past 2 nights, I needed him, and it was torturous.

As I said, don't ever be with someone because you pity them. That is not a good relationship. You'll only get back together for a few months, get miserable again, then leave him once more. \n\nI'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but this is the advice you need, rather than the advice you probably want to hear. You cannot be with this man. He's making you miserable. He's making you depressed for goodness sake. He's stealing money from you. He's an absolute train wreck. You need to say no more. Dating him out of pity isn't only bad for you, it's bad for him. You need to move on for yours and his sake. You should be with someone who makes you happy. Who treats you like you're royalty.

What I can say is: it was so worth resisting it!\n\nYou mention that we are all going to die eventually, right? So, why not make most of life? Its not the destination that matters, but the ride!\n\nSee, the things you mention are a big deal for you exactly because you care so much, which in the end is a good trait of you and one through which you can make the world so much better in your stay.\n\nNow, for the practical stuff:\n\n1- If you REALLY don't like these music classes, is it possible to substitute it for some other activity? Talk to your parents, tell you want to try something new! even if its something you can't change,  worst case scenario you will have to handle for just a couple more years, less than 5% of your ride\n\n2- you don't make people unhappy, that simply doesn't exist! Even if you were the worst person on land, someone's happiness depends solely on the person. Everything else just contributes to the effort they have to put in.\n\n3- You found some things you are into, awesome! Pursue that, not because you might want a career... But to satisfy your curiosity! The feeling of learning, understanding something you are excited to should be enough\n\nSo, if i could give any suggestions from a more experienced perspective: don't take life so seriously. Go out, focus on something you like or never have done. Distract yourself. Humans are creatures of habits, you won't lose the ones that you dislike if not putting something else to occupy that time.\n\nAnd finally, most of what you do now is not as determinant of your life as you're led to believe.

That said, playing an instrument well is a long term win in terms of picking up women, so think carefully before you drop it.\n\n&gt; I do not want to tell any of my friends how I feel.\n\nActually I think this is good. People do tend to avoid depressive people. What I would try and do though is try and get as much pleasure and happiness out of friendship as possible\n\n&gt; I cannot think of anything positive about the future\n\nYes you're right,  everyone **is** going to die. However, I think its worthwhile to get every moment of pleasure you can out of life before kicking the bucket\n\n&gt; why should I live if my life is so insignificant\n\nYou don't know if your life is going to be insignificant at 14. My life didn't start becoming significant till my late 20s when I became (moderately) famous in my field of work and also lost my virginity. Before then I was a withdrawn loner.\n\n&gt; My sister is better than me.\n\nYou have to stop competing with your sister. She's not better, she's different. I am ugly, terrible at sports, struggle to socialise, and not quite tall enough. My brother is 6'3\", fit, can sell ice cream to Eskimo's. I did things very different to what my brother did and as a result I don't compete with him. \n\n&gt; My parents say I have no other interests, but I do. I chose psychology as a GCSE option....\n\nCongratulations, you've found something interesting. Now find other interesting things. Life is about learning about interesting stuff and doing interesting things.",

My first semester in college I failed all of my classes and now I make As and Bs.\n\nMy advice to you is to just stop for a day take what I call Mental Health Days and just relax don't think about school don't think about anything but relaxation.

                "There is still time because it's half of the school year. I am in high school too, and I know how it feels to have low grades, it gives me severe anxiety. If you're struggling, try to seek help from your teachers or ask your parents to find a tutor? Do you ever ask your parents to help you out? \nA few good apps I use to help me in school is Quizlet and my Homework. In quizlet, you can create your own notes and there are a few ways to study, and you can even make a test from the notes and take it as practice. I highly recommend because taking notes and studying in different ways rather than just looking at them on paper has helped me by a long shot. It stimulates the brain and is better for memory. My Homework app is like an agenda, if you don't have time or like to write on paper, I recommend this app. You can divide into classes, add class info, list the priority of the homework, add the due date, and it just divides &amp; organizes your work for the week. I don't know what I would do without these two apps. Please try your best, I know you can do it! If you truly care about your future, change this, it's all in your power. You can change those grades. And do better senior year, just keep track of yourself and do your best, ok? ",
                "\"I feel if I keep this up my life is meaningless\" Please realize the power you have within you. You can achieve anything, ANYTHING you want if you set your mind to it. I know depression is tough, I have struggled with it myself and it sucks. It's like I feel like I'm a great person with potential but I sabotage myself. Trust me you have to win the fight between yourself. Don't let your negative side win. Work for your positive side instead. \n\nYou're in highschool. This does not dictate whether or not you will live a successful life or not. I FLUNKED high school but turned it around in college and now I've been given scholarships to play sports at a university. Things can and will get better if you work for it. Yes only if you work for it. Try to accept that sh*t is just plain harder when depressed, but it's important that you keep pushing forward because the storm will pass and the spring will come. \n\nIf your bad grades make you sad, do better next semester. Your solution is simple please don't dwell, it doesn't get you anywhere. Realize that life is LOOONG. 1 mistake doesn't dictate your future and neither does 1 success. Live life in the moment. On a moment to moment basis think to yourself, \"How can I create the future I want?\" Set goals for yourself than be proud of yourself for achieving them, big or small goals. The main tip: Believe in yourself, and don't give up. Those 2 things are unstoppable when put together",
