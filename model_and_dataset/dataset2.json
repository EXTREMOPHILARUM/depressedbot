However, many people have told me that I am depressed even though I don\u2019t feel like I am. I do often have thoughts about suicide but I don\u2019t think I would ever act on them. I\u2019ve never once cut myself or done any bodily harm in any way, but I do frequently think about ways I could kill myself and what the outcome of that would be.

There\u2019s a lot more that goes on but to me I don\u2019t see this as depression but more of just minuscule issues that I play out and make a bigger deal than they really are, since I know many people do seriously suffer from mental issues and I feel like these things aren\u2019t important compared to something like real depression.", "answer": ["Well, I\u2019m just a guy who\u2019s been suffering from persistent severe depression for 15 years now, but even so (especially so, really), I\u2019d never try to diagnose you based on a paragraph online.

I have had struggles some would call more difficult than this one but for some reason I find this the most difficult. By the way for context I am 18 and just graduated high school this May. \n\nLast summer a girl I knew liked me and for multiple reasons I decided not to date her. First of all she was dating a new guy every month and I didn\u2019t want to get heartbroken. Secondly I was super focused on my business and working out and wasn\u2019t thinking to much about her. Thirdly and this one hurts the most is that I didn\u2019t find her that attractive and thought I could do better. Just typing that makes me cry and feel like a shallow asshole. \n\nAnyways the school year begins and she finds this sophomore she would end up dating all school year up until now. This may sound stupid but freshman I just dreamed that I could take a girl to homecoming, prom, the football games and just have a great fun relationship by the time I was a senior. \n\nHowever I feel like I completely passed up this opportunity I have been looking forward towards since freshman year and had to spend the year watching her have those times with someone else. I feel like I would be the only one stupid enough to pass up something like this. Anyways high school is now over and I feel like I have lost. I have no other ambitions or goals in life and just can\u2019t live with this regret eating away at me everyday. People have told me before that I have my whole life ahead of me and all that but the chance to be able to have a high school relationship is over. I feel like the game is over and I have lost. \n\n\nI would assume that people are wondering why I put such high standards on high school and wonder why I care so much. So I just want  to say that during my life I really was an outcast and never fit in anywhere. Girls thought I was unattractive and guys thought I was a unathletic loser. During my freshman year I became infatuated with this beautiful popular girl and I my class. Now in the past I would usually just tell myself I was wasn\u2019t good enough and just to move on but I decided to quit acting like a loser and put my foot down and try to improve myself.\n\nSince that time I have built a business that makes me $50k passively which I believe in the next two years will go to a 100k passively.  I also went from a weak tall lanky kid to a much more tall and muscular looking man which I believe are improvements that make me a more attractive person who could actually get a girlfriend. \n\nHowever I have realized how shallow my way of thinking was over the years and I don\u2019t necessarily regret all of it I was to obsessed and it cost me a lot of potential good times. My family, friends and teachers are extremely impressed on what I have become and think I will grow up to be very successful one day. But deep down I don\u2019t really care about any of this shit anymore. I enjoy making money ever since I was a kid and used to trade on the stock market for fun but that fact that most of society deems this as successful and the key to happiness is just wrong. Sadly I bought into that theory way to much and if anyone is reading this thinking money is what is going to make you happy, I can tell you from my personal experience money will not make you that much happier if you are already not happy with yourself. The only thing that really makes me happy is that this girl will be going to the same community college as me and give me hope that maybe she will break up with her sophomore boyfriend and date me. Anyways if anyone has some advice for me or wants to call me crazy all comments are appreciated and I will respond to anything. Thanks for taking the time to read this.", "answer": ["You weren't shallow. When look at this, I see someone who's taking up new opportunities. You're 18 with a business that makes a lot of money, and you're an athletic guy who takes care of themselves physically. You have a lot to be proud of. I despise using this word, but if anything, you can say you were ignorant. We all have tremendous opportunities that pass us by and we didn't even realize it until we look back. It's great that you had this vision of what high school would be, and it sucks that you couldn't achieve it. But honestly, high school is probably the worst place to find true love, since most people haven't matured enough to understand what it means to be in a loving relationship. Although you didn't like the way that girl looked, the real reason you turned her down was because you didn't want to be heartbroken, and you wanted something real; you didn't care about having a fling or having someone on your arm. Believe it or not, that shows tremendous character.\nIt's super difficult to see it now (I'm still struggling), but high school is not real life. Now that you're entering a new stage in your life, the system is different. You're going to be meeting people interested in the things you are and who can appreciate who you are as a person, and not as sometime to hang out with at lunch every day. It's hard to look back and know that you'll never be able to take that girl to prom and homecoming, but when you meet someone who you love and really loves you, it won't matter. It's all about looking forward. It's a hard pill to swallow, but try and put that dream on the shelf along with your past dreams of being a rockstar or an astronaut. In the end, you'll see that you having a dream like that shows you who you are and what you value. You can't see what you'll become if you don't stay to watch.\nHope you feel better soon, I'm right here with you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Honestly I don\u2019t think I can put that dream away. I dreamed about that last year so much and worked so hard it\u2019s to difficult to live with the fact that I just threw away the opportunity to have it when it was right in my face. I look at the past in disgust and the future doesn\u2019t look bright at all. I need some kind of way to forgive myself. Maybe I am a romantic but the whole high school relationship just sounded like the best a relationship could get. Maybe it has been glorified that way to me by movies but I want to have moments like that with someone more than I want anything else on this earth. I just feel as if it is over.

I\u2019m 22yo and I want to die almost every day. As time goes on, the thoughts of suicide increased and seem more and more appealing. It started to get scary for me once I realized that the one thing stopping me from actually offing myself (the pain I would cause others around me) didn\u2019t matter to me anymore and that dying would be worth it. Because id be dead and nothing would matter. The only thing stopping me now is the fear of becoming paralyzed or failing the attempt and having to live with that. So I just hope every day I get hit by a car on my way to work or die by some kind of freak accident. I feel so alone all the time even though I have supportive friends/family. While I\u2019m not alone physically, mentally I can\u2019t help but feel worthless and like people hate me. I know the cliche of people telling depressed people that they\u2019re \u201cnot a burden\u201d I just feel like that\u2019s untrue. I feel like this issue is consistent enough that having to have someone help me and comfort me when I become this way prevents them from living their best life and it takes away from their happiness. I know that being around me is not easy when I am depressed or having an anxiety attack. I have a really hard time verbalizing my thoughts and feelings because I feel like if I don\u2019t say them out loud then they won\u2019t be as real. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working very hard on these last few years but it\u2019s still a work in progress. I know that might sound crazy but it\u2019s just how I rationalize my lack of coping mechanisms I guess. I feel like I can pinpoint all of my issues and I\u2019m pretty self aware. I want to change desperately but for some reason I can never pull myself out of the void once I feel myself sink in. And it\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s hard for the close ones around me trying to help. I can\u2019t let them in no matter how much I want to. I just feel like there\u2019s only so much someone can do before giving up on you. It tears me up inside. I\u2019m worried about my relationship failing because of my inability to fight the depression. We\u2019ve been together nearly 6 years and he is the most amazing and supportive person I\u2019ve ever met. But a person can only take so much for so long. In my opinion anyways. I lay in bed most of the day usually sleeping or watching videos when I\u2019m not working my full-time job + a part-time job to just barely be able to pay my bills. The financial stress of being 22 years old, fully self sufficient, living in a big city is insane. I have a history of disordered eating that I\u2019ve noticed resurface this past year. I eat, on average, maybe 6-8 small meals a week. I know eating helps stabilize mood but my ED makes me actually physically nauseous even just thinking about food. Attempting to eat triggers my gag reflex and I\u2019ve puked on several occasions just trying to satiate myself. I just try to tell myself that these thoughts are temporary and that better times will come and make living worth it. I don\u2019t know if I even believe that but trying to have some optimism helps a little. Ive used marijuana as a crutch to help deal with my ED/depression for years, smoking several times daily. I actually just decided last week that it\u2019s time for a break (hopefully to quit permanently). I feel like it used to help but it has just started to hurt me and I haven\u2019t even enjoyed smoking for a long time I just do it out of habit. I feel like it\u2019s making me stupid. On top of my depression that I also feel makes me stupid. Obviously I know healthy diet, exercise/meditation/breath work help symptoms. But committing and forcing myself to do these things regularly seems nearly impossible for me. I can\u2019t find joy or interest in ANYTHING. Which makes it really hard to distract my mind from my thoughts. Antidepressants/anxiety medications (viibryd) have also helped me in the past but I\u2019m not financially stable enough currently to go see a doctors. And I\u2019m not feeling this way every day, it comes and it goes. But it comes and goes fairly frequently. frequently enough that it gets insanely exhausting having to constantly regulate my thoughts and tell myself to snap out of it. If I repress, things get worse. If I let it out, I spiral out of control. I\u2019m not looking for people to tell me that things get better, I\u2019m hoping someone can offer useful guidance, tips or advice to maybe help me pull myself out of the void when I fall in.

Can you clarify what you said (I know I sound like a idiot )", "I am scared to talk to my parents about this"]}, {"tag": 50023, "question": "This is going to be real long, but stick with me if you can. \n\nLittle background: Parents died young, other traumas, first panic attack at 15, family has long history of depression, addiction, suicide, been on meds for about 15 years now. \n\nI've had such a hard time my whole life with depression and anxiety, but I've been bounced back and forth from Dr. to Dr. and med to med, so it's just become so exhausting. I'll be ok for a few years and then have a big breakdown, followed by a new Dr/therapist and a change in meds. The breakdowns don't usually last more than a few weeks, but my one three years ago lasted about 2 months and then my most recent has been since August. This has just been an ongoing cycle. I finally, just now in my 30's, found a Dr I really trust and is really trying and instead of spending just 5 minutes and writing a prescription he actually takes so much time to talk to me. So I trust him. We did a med change last summer and it was the worst experience of my life, I reacted very badly to it. So I came off it slowly and there's been a few adjustments but I'd say we're about 9 months in and I'm no longer in crisis mode but I am depressed or anxious, every day. Some days are a lot better, but so much of this is existential, which is hard to deal with in therapy (I need a new therapist, I think this one has gone as far as she can go) because there ARE no answers, which sends me into an insane spiral of panic. So it's definitely existential doom and gloom topped with crippling fear of control and the unknown. I am just, so tired. My husband is some kind of magic because he had been 100% by my side though all of this, but sometimes when I talk to him, I know he just can't understand it. \n\nLike I said it's been on and off, bounced around, med after med for 15 years and I'm starting to think I'm running out of options. Not that I'm contemplating anything drastic, like I said, a lot of this stems from the unknown, so dying is not an option for me. I need help getting over my fear of the unknown, getting acceptance of not having control. Is there anything someone can recommend, maybe a book or show? I need something to click and idk what it is. If this new round of meds doesn't work, we're going to try and see what happens if I come off of meds, because my brain chemistry has obv changed over the years and who even knows what my base line is anymore.  (I honestly might think if I was in continuous therapy with someone I trusted, it wouldn't have gotten this bad, but American health care amirite?) My entire family has depression and addiction problems, so I know this will probably end up as a mixture of therapy and some kind of med, I just have to get over my fears, and feel grounded, and connected. Sometimes I can feel 100% alone in the whole universe even in a room full of people. It's also a sensation I have a hard time explaining, like, I'm not here, or I am here but nothing around me is real, because \"what is real?\". I don't know what to call that.\n\nI feel like my med induced breakdown took me past an edge where I'm not going to fully come back from. \n\nStories, recommendations, books, different approaches, what's worked for you, all welcomed. I like to look at a lot of different approaches because I don't think just one person has the answers. If they did, we wouldn't be in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading the whole thing if you got this far. Even just a \"hey, I know what that's like, I just eat carbs when I'm sad\" is a response I can relate to. \n\nThank you in advance for all your responses, I've always found comfort in knowing there's so many people that understand. Unfortunately I think a lot of people who have gotten past their depression and the majority of the success stories don't come back to the subs, so I can sometimes feel like it's negative.", "answer": ["Hey! I feel ya!!!! The good news is that you can beat your depression!!! \n\nMy partner had depression for many many years!! He was on meds for a long time, he went to counseling (I even went with him to know better how to help him and to learn to not let his depression get to me - because it certainly does!)\n\nSo here is what worked:\n1. Regular exercise. It doesn\u2019t need to be every day. Start with a commitment of going to the gym once a week. And stick with that! Don\u2019t expect miracles and give up after 1 month because you are not feeling happier. \nAlso, in order to be effective, the exercise needs to elevate your heart beat for 30 minutes or so (therapist recommendation). We enrolled in a cardio class, so we stay more motivated than walking in the boring treadmill. \n\n2. Meditation/mindful classes. Game changer! It really helps and there are tons os studies proving that it can be as effective as meds!! This was another of the therapist\u2019s recommendation. \nCan\u2019t find one in your community? There is tons online! \n\n3. Healthy diet. Tons of veggies and fruits. No soda! Cut the crappy sugar! ;-)\n\n4. Take a vitamin D supplement. Go on short walks 2 or 3 times a week. Keep active! \n\n5.

I have been trying getting back into exercise, which has been really hard because when my heart rate increases, I can't breathe and I have a panic attack. Like I said, it's really bad right now, so a lot triggers it. I also went to the Dr. and said my thyroid feels big which could be bringing on the feeling of not being able to breathe when exercising, so that's being worked on too. \n2. the mindful meditation, works sometimes, other times it is pure torture, my mind becomes obsessive and will work myself into a panic. I try that first though, sometimes it works, sometimes it makes it a lot worse. I did a salt float therapy, which was great meditation, but expensive. \n3. My diet is improving, when it was real bad, I was just accepting that I was actually eating, no matter what it was. \n4. I have always been on heaps of Vitamin D, I've always been so so low\n5. Books, I listened to the Subtle art of Not Giving a F*ck, as I tried to lay and calm at the same time, it made it worse, I'm not sure why, but I can try again. I wen't a little crazy and rented every single mental health and coping book from my library over a few months and got too overwhelmed because I can't comprehend the amount of info. My therapist says I need to rein it in back to what is in my immediate life, not search for every single possibility because I just can't process that amount of information right now. So when I go off and spiral I have to remind myself, \"Bring it back in, that's going too far\"\n\nI also just wake up with the feeling of fear, so just waking up triggers it, which is intense and really hard to have the time to meditate or do some things before work except take half a xanax and try and calm once I'm at work."]}, {"tag": 50024, "question": "I'm not good at talking, but I think I need to.

I'm also way too old to be couch surfing in the first place. While I haven't actually been diagnosed, it's probably a safe bet that I have some level of PTSD (I'm a veteran), and that doesn't help any. I suppose I'm not as bad off as some... while I am depressed, I'm not (and really haven't ever been) suicidal, so that's a tiny ray of sunshine. While I do think that there's very little point to life lately, I don't actually think that ending it is a worthwhile pursuit either, so I just keep struggling along hoping that I'll find a way to buck the odds and actually get a step ahead. Also... I'm rambling. I'm actually a pretty good writer usually, but for some reason I seem to forget how to write professionally when I'm talking about my own problems.

My family life is not at all healthy. I have problems that were caused by my family life. I myself also have health problems which suck. They really do (including anxiety. Not so depression but I have had depression last a long time but that was when my family life was extremely terrible. It\u2019s ok now, but a few years ago it was awful). But I keep moving forward. And I know it\u2019s hard. There are days that I want to end it. Where I just think I\u2019d be better off dead. And these aren\u2019t just thoughts that happened years ago. These are thoughts that have happened in the past week. Through my high school I had no friends. And the people I thought were my friends used me and I found out way to late. I wasn\u2019t at all what you\u2019d call handsome. I wasn\u2019t fit. I wasn\u2019t strong. I was just me. And I hated it. I wanted to end it. I really did.

If you ever need help with anything, you can PM me. I\u2019ll be more than happy to help.", "Hey girl, I see you. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re posting here because that shows you really want some help. I can offer some advice or just share a little about my life, just something so you know I hear you. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered with depression and anxiety since I was a pre teen, and I say always say suffered because depression will take you to some dark places and it is a STRUGGLE. I\u2019m not saying this to make you feel like you might as well give up or anything like that, just to be crystal clear. I just want you to know that living with and managing this stuff is possible but you have to fight like hell and never let your guard down. You can take this as a burden you are saddled with or you can take it as a purpose. You know a lot of people go through life with no real purpose, but here you are, all set up with a purpose for the rest of your life. \n\nYour purpose is to not let \u201cit\u201d win. You can\u2019t. You didn\u2019t ask for this but here it is, trying to leech all of the good out of life, making you feel unloved, taking your motivation and your joy. It\u2019s not fair but you don\u2019t have to take it. Fight it with all you have. I mean it. We weren\u2019t put on this earth to feel like that all the time and if our brain chemicals tend to disagree we have to work around the little messes they make. It\u2019s entirely possible and if I can do it, you can do it. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I can tell you: \n\nDon\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel bad for having mental health issues. Some people are really misinformed and some are just mean spirited but they can only make you feel as bad as you let them. Imagine making someone feel bad for having diabetes or lupus, it sounds ridiculous but people can be assholes. Don\u2019t be afraid to let them know they are being an asshole either. And don\u2019t YOU ever feel like you are less or broken or weak because you struggle with your mental health. You didn\u2019t do anything to cause this. \n\nTry antidepressants. I know some people disagree with this and you will make the best choice for you but - it\u2019s 2019, they make medicine for this stuff. It\u2019s not a perfect science but considering all you have to lose without trying to treat it, I think the benefits outweigh the risks. \n\nBUT, don\u2019t let a doctor just give you antidepressants without agreeing to monitor and adjust those meds every couple months, like I said not perfect and honestly a pain in the ass, but you\u2019ll feel better. \n\nDo not just take meds without counseling or therapy. Sure, the meds work on your brain chemistry, but combining them with talk therapy increases the efficacy of the drugs. You can take therapy breaks and still take the meds, but get yourself a good, solid foundation first. \n\nGo to counseling/therapy. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and costs money you\u2019d rather spend on something else but you\u2019ll be surprised how totally off your thinking can get. Someone who can help you reframe the way your brain looks at things will help more than you think. \n\nSwitch counselors or therapists as needed and don\u2019t feel bad about it. You\u2019re going to have to like and connect with this person to get any real value. But therapists are just humans and not all humans are compatible, so just be very patient and find one you click with. It\u2019ll work so much better. \n\nEat well and take vitamins &amp; supplements, drink plenty of good old water and exercise as much as you can. Get the best possible sleep you can every night. This took me a long time to come to terms with, but once I did I started feeling a lot better. Who knew that my struggling brain needed better fuel than Taco Bell &amp; Pepsi to function and that the symptoms of dehydration can mimic a lot of mental health issues? And just FYI I SUCK at exercising and I\u2019m not saying train for a marathon, just do something you enjoy as frequently as possible. \n\nTake a social media break. If you are bombarded by pics of what seems to be everyone else\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d life, it\u2019ll mess with you. Keep in mind, all that perfectness is just on the surface. Even during my worst times, where all I could think about was swallowing all my pills, I posted every selfie I could to prove how \u201chappy\u201d I was. It\u2019s all a lie. \n\nDon\u2019t self medicate. Just don\u2019t. We Americans man, we know how to kill our feelings and there are 100 ways to do it.  Booze, pot, video games...whatever we need to check out, it\u2019s pretty easy to get. I\u2019m not saying this because I am some saint or anything, I\u2019m saying it because I\u2019ve tried all of it and it doesn\u2019t help. Seems like it for just a minute and then everything gets worse. Depending on what you get into, you could slip and saddle yourself with an addiction on top of the other issues and trust me you do not want that. Not only will it probably set you back years in trying to feel better, addiction can steal everything from you. And when you have nothing left it will go after your family, friends and anyone around you. I really don\u2019t want to sound preachy, but it is SO EASY for people like me and you to do this and I\u2019ve lived enough years to see some of the worst shit addiction can do and I do not want that for you. So just be so careful around drugs and alcohol.  There are people who can mess around with them with no worries, but if you\u2019re already feeling as bad as your post says on the inside, it\u2019s just too easy to slip into something you might never come out of. Just keep your guard up ok? \n\nGo easy on yourself. There are going to be some shitty days and if you can\u2019t get out of bed once in awhile, stay in bed if you can. If a week has taken everything out of you just to get through, who cares what your house/room/car/whatever looks like. That shit can wait and sometimes you have to rest without feeling guilty. \n\nSounds so easy right? Oh yeah, I\u2019ll just get up and do all that right away! IGET it. When you\u2019re depressed it\u2019s like wearing 100 lb weights on all your limbs. Everything seems gray and the stuff you used to like doesn\u2019t matter and you are just so tired. There\u2019s been months where I only made it from the couch to work and back and nothing else. Months. Where the only thing that would bring me any comfort was thinking about dying and how I could just end all of this. Where I barely showered, ate whatever I could pick up at a fast food joint...just laid there. I get it. I got all the advice like \u201cJust go outside!\u201d  Sure, I haven\u2019t had the energy to brush my teeth in 3 days but I\u2019ll get right on that.  Just start with one baby step. Just one. Call your doctor and make an appointment. Show up to the appointment. Be honest at the appointment about how bad it is. Tell someone what\u2019s going on and if you don\u2019t have anyone in your life you can talk to, talk to the peeps in some of these subreddits. DM me anytime. Posting here was a good baby step! I know everything is so exhausting right now but I promise you if you do one thing towards getting yourself better it will lead to more and more steps and little by little you\u2019ll get better, not perfect, but better. Remember people like you and I have to have a little bit of extra fight in us because of our purpose. You can do this. Read that again. You can do this. You can have a life with good times and friends and all the things that come along and you are going to learn how to handle the bad stuff in a different way. Just fight with me, ok? \n\nI\u2019m here.", "Hey mkletmedie,\n\nMy turn for a way too long message. You seriously don't have to read all this, the others already said a lot of helpful stuff. Either way, here we go OP &amp; anyone else reading this, I hope this helps.\n\n\n\nFirstly, even when we feel like we're burdening others, whether it's because we're depressed or need someone there for us, usually it isn't that black &amp; white.\nWhen it's someone who cares about us, people likely are willing &amp; want to go out of their way to help/comfort us, it's how we can reassure one another that we're there when things are hard. If it's with someone we're not quite as familiar with, some people can be everything but helpful, but other times people like to help simply because they know what it's like to struggle, either like we do or similiarly, or they do it out of the kindness of their heart.\n\nOur environment can seem very cold &amp; dark, it is, but not all of it. There may not be many, but there are good people. And those types of people don't feel burdened, they feel trusted &amp; warmth because we let them in, let them help us. It's part of having healthy relationships, a concept that I struggle with as well.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry your parents are so tough on you, I know what you mean, but when it comes to forgetting your social anxiety, overthinking, &amp; depression, that is everything but fair. They should be more considerate &amp; supportive, they're doing the opposite. I don't know how open or comfortable you are with talking to them, but mabe taking one of them aside or so &amp; trying to explain to them a bit what the screaming &amp; other stuff does to you can help enlighten them. I know that would be difficult, but hopefully it wouldn't make it worse, it might be worth a try. It's suprising how much a honest conversation can do, but both sides have to be open to that.\n\n\nThere is no absolute way of knowing that life will get better &amp; that you will be happy. Life is a cold heartless bitch that takes &amp; rarely gives something in return. It's chaotic. But it does have it's ups &amp; downs, mostly our lives oscillates between those, things don't stay bad &amp; good things &amp; people come and go. Losing people... it's another subject, perhaps, but not everyone is meant to stay, the same way not all feelings &amp; situations will stay forever. Some things will stay, some of the unhappiness, some of the emptiness, a few suicidal thoughts....\nBut that doesn't mean we can't fight them. I know you're probably tired of hearing this, or just combating these things in general, but every time we try to push back a little bit, confront those dark thoughts &amp; feeling, every time we make just a little bit more progress. And that's the best we can do. Slowly but surely. Of course that doesn't guarantee things will be better, but it means that things will be able.\n\nAnd then there are things &amp; people &amp; events that make taking those steps towards improving our situation harder. Like that creepy, disgusting old man. It might happen again, there seems to be no limit as to how many people can't keep their mouths shut, hands to themselves, &amp; use common sense &amp; respect other people. Assholes like that exist. But that doesn't mean we or our future is defined by people like them.\nBeing alone, or feeling like we are, does that too. Both are valid &amp; make every challenge we face harder.\n\n---\n\nI know you think that it's impossible for anyone to like or care about you. I feel that way too. But even with our imperfections, we're still loveable, still worthy of being cared about.\nOthers in the past, present, &amp; future may treat us terribly. Rarely it's justified, but sometimes people just don't get what it's like to be the way we are. We are different, in some ways. But that doesn't mean we're broken or messed up. It doesn't mean we aren't human or have the same rights. We're still who we are &amp; that means that despite everything, we aren't worthless. I know you don't believe me, I barely do myself, but I know that you &amp; I have done things that have meant something before. Our actions aren't as meaningless as we think, we influence the people we are around everyday, &amp; no, I don't just mean negatively.\n\nI'm sorry your friends &amp; sister didn't ask if you want to join them &amp; that your parents were so insensitive. It isn't you being emotional or anything, it sounds very familiar &amp; I'm guessing these types of things have been happening a lot recently &amp; it's built up to you feeling like this. Regardless of whether we have people who care about us all around us, very few or them, or next to none, we can still feel very, very alone.\n\nI hope really badly that you're parents are somewhat supportive or that perhaps you have someone to talk to, even though it doesn't sound like it. Friends. It's a difficult topic, but even if you don't have any, that doesn't mean your worthless or broken or unattractive. It just means you struggle, like others, to perhaps forge new connections. I know it's not easy, ever since I was a child I didn't really have anyone who was there, &amp; even as I grew up, I felt as though every left me eventually, if we connected to begin with.\n\nSolitude, whether like that or in another form does things too us, but even then it doesn't ban us from ever making important relationships with beautiful people.\n\n---\n\nI know how that sounds, but even with the mental illnesses &amp; other factors, you aren't undesireable or unloveable. You aren't. This isn't convincing, but it's about who you are on the inside, despite all these other things that may make up part of you, but absolutely, definitely not all of you. These things only define you if you let them, I know there are other much more defining features.\n\nEven if you're depressed &amp; have anxiety &amp; these other things, you can still be a charming &amp; an amazing person who is capable of achieving her goals. Yes, it makes things more difficult at times, but that does not make them impossible.\n\nI'm not always/often sure, but I hope &amp; think that all this pain we endure will &amp; is worth it. That despite all our hardships &amp; the suffering, the pain &amp; endless loss, that we can make the best out of what we have &amp; perhaps somehow, eventually, with a lot of effort that won't always be there, be able to be happier &amp; do/have what we want.\n\nYou already said you're on meds, but I think talking to someone would be critical to helping you feel a little better. At the very least finding a healthy way for you to voice &amp; confront your thoughts &amp; emotions. I know, I know, therapy &amp;/or being honest about we feel can be terrifying, but seriously, if we aren't will to accept something has to change, we can't move forward.\n\nYou are absolutely more than welcome to reply to this (write me) incase this isn't a throwaway or something, if you need someone to talk to I'm here. I would be more than happy too, you wouldn't be bothering me at all. I'm here.\n\nYou don't have to be alone. Reaching out to someone, whether online or irl can be really helpful. You can always ask for advice or someone to talk to on other subreddits if you like:\n\nr/depression\nr/helpme\nr/KindVoice\nr/offmychest\nr/SuicideWatch\n(etc.)\n\nI'm sorry things have been so hard for you, in general &amp; especially lately. I wish you the best of luck, I hope this helped, &amp; don't hesitate to let me know if I can do anything else."]}, {"tag": 50027, "question": "Note: I am not suicidal, but I do have those moments if you know what I mean. Throwaway because my older brother uses reddit. I posted this to r/depression as well.\n\nI am a 15 year old boy, and for the past few years I feel my parents have been somewhat overbearing. I love them and they are good people with good intentions, but I feel they overwhelm me sometimes.\n\nWhenever I have to do chores like sweeping or mopping the floor, if I miss a small part of the floor, my parents (dad especially) will get on me and say things like \"90% is not good enough in the real world\", and say that because I missed a spot it doesn't count until I get everything properly. They call me lazy, and sometimes underhandedly insult my intelligence, even though they keep telling me I'm not stupid. To be fair, sometimes I am lazy and just do it half-ass but sometimes I genuinely missed it and I still get berated. Another thing is my grades (I am enrolled in an online school), they aren't super strict with it, but even if I get 90% they don't even really acknowledge it beyond \"good, but it could be better\". I am a good student overall with mostly A+, just lazy sometimes and If I make a mistake on a quiz and get something like 83% when they receive the email (they get email notifications when I submit an assignment and when an assignment is graded) they kinda question me about it. They told me that will kick me out at 18 if I'm not \"doing something\" meaning learned a skill and getting a job (I can't get a job in the country I live in because I'm not a citizen at least until I get a work visa, and most of companies don't hire many foreigners unless the company is owned by foreigners so I would have to get a higher-skill job) I kinda get it but I feel the burden is quite heavy to put on me at my age (they've been telling me this since I was 13) especially with the other things they are pushing me to do. Over the past few years I've lost interest in almost everything I had interest in (coding, soccer, music production and others) and the only thing that gives me some degree of pleasure is video games and internet surfing. I have a small interest in US politics (I'm half-American), even though I don't want to pursue a career in that field, it's just an interest. My dad basically told me it was a waste of time to be reading and learning about politics if I wasn't going to pursue it further, and as a result I am slowly but not completely losing interest in that as well. I am lazy sometimes, which may or may not be from my depression. I don't know what to think because it's like the chicken and the egg question, is it the laziness that made me depressed, which is making me more lazy and more depressed, or is it the other way around? Maybe I am just a lazy teenager who's using depression as an excuse, or maybe I am depressed. I don't know. Some occasions after getting yelled at I just go into the bathroom and cry for several minutes and think to myself \"maybe I am useless idiot who will get nowhere in life\". My dad has told me that maybe I am depressed, but it's not an excuse and on one occasion said everyone has depression, he also said that if I am depressed that nothing he says will matter as I will only ending up killing myself; my mom seems to agree with him. Needless to say, telling him I have depression is not going to do much. They've started doing these things when I was around 12, even more once I became a teen. Their intent isn't malicious and I know that they are trying to prepare me for the \"real world\" but it's really weighing on me. Even worse is because I'm home schooled in a foreign country I can speak the language but there aren't many kids that I can connect with like someone who's more like me, so I don't have any friends except one person who comes and goes every year or so. I know this is quite long and there's more I want to say, but I don't want make it too long. I just want some people to talk to and to cheer me up a little, so I will try to reply to comments as much as I can.", "answer": ["Please ensure you have selected a flair for your post.

Example:\n\n\u2022 I feel anxious about asking for help with work; I think everyone hates me; I think about how people have hated me in the past; then I think about how I deserve to have everyone hate me; and then I just want someone to kill me.\n\nBut my mood will swing every few hours, and I do sometimes feel happy, so I have convinced myself not to seek help over it (dumb, I know).\n\nThe happier I feel, the more sad/shameful I will feel later, and I'll feel worse for longer.\n\nIf I'm only slightly happy, then I'm less ashamed/sad, and less suicidal.\n\nTrying to balance my mood is incredibly difficult when my brain won't even bother to work. \n\nI know how to do certain jobs at work, but these past few weeks in particular, have been awful. I can't think, and can't work, and then harass myself, and then follow the cycle that I mentioned above.\n\n------\n\nI'm also incredibly skinny, because I can't find it in myself to eat. I have a slice of toast in the morning, and small chocolate bar in the afternoon, and my dinner (which is usually a full plate, since my parents cook dinner for me, and I don't want to be rude to them).\n\n------\n\nI am seeing a therapist, finally, on Monday, but I feel like I need antidepressants to help sort myself out.\n\nI can't keep going like this, but I can't see myself changing anytime soon, and I can't find it in myself to kill myself (I'd need someone else to do it for me).\n\nI could just be being dramatic, and I feel aeful that people in my life have to deal with my shit.\n\nIf any of you have managed to read through **all of this**, thanks.\n\nI know it's a lot, but I just needed to let it all out.", "answer": ["Please ensure you have selected a flair for your post.

I've not had an easy go but always tried hard to better myself and get well. I got sober 1.5 years ago, am in therapy, regularly practice yoga and meditation, take antidepressants, get plenty of sleep, eat well, the whole fucking thing. I have a wonderful supportive husband whom I love, and with whom I had looked forward to building a life and having a family. \n\nAnd yet my depression still remains. In the last year, I have studied philosophy and spirituality and religion and cosmology and neuroscience and evolution and the more I learn the more I am convinced: there is no benevolent god, the universe is random and absurd, and life is essentially meaningless. There may have been a creator entity, but its far removed from humanity. I recently watched True Detective and the main character says, *\"I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody.\"* I agree with this statement entirely and had never heard anyone say it so succinctly. \n\nI have felt an urge to try and find some meaning in the world and in my life, that maybe I could climb out of the hole of depression someday, in many ways because of my husband. Until now. My husband is leaving me. He just started his dream job a few months ago, and he's suddenly decided he wants that more than me. That he wants to throw his whole life into work, and doesn't want to be married, or have a family, anymore. (Note: He is not leaving because I am depressed - he is leaving because he doesn't think he can be a good husband for me while he does this job, and this job is more important to him than I am.)\n\nThis pain...its just not bearable. It cuts to the heart in a way that is not describable. I fall to my knees sobbing and begging the universe to give me a sign, ANY sign, that I should keep going, that there is something worth living for, that there is some meaning in this, that the pain will be worth it in the end. But there is no sign coming. \n\nAnd I look at the world and the enormity of suffering in other places, where children are slaughtered in wars, where women are beaten and raped, where people shoot up schools and kill kindergartners...I look at the people who COULD NOT get sober, at the people who COULD NOT get well, or the people who never had a chance to, because their life was randomly taken from them in a car crash or from cancer or some other bullshit reason. \n\nAnd then I think about the evolution of humankind. I think of all of the millions of creatures that evolved from reptiles to mammals to apes to hominids. At what point did homo sapiens become conscious beings? At one point did we discover sense of \"self\"? At what point did \"meaning\" begin to matter to us?  For all of the many millions of beings that lived before that moment - they had no meaning or purpose. And they represent the VAST majority of the history of animals, of life. And that life? Only represents a tiny fraction of the history of this universe. \n\n**There. Is. No. Meaning.** There is no way to reconcile how some people have the chances and opportunities to grow and to get stronger, while others do not. There is no way to reconcile the fact that our suffering is a blip in comparison to the enormity of the universe and spacetime.", "answer": ["Even IF there was no meaning to life, no purpose to our breaths we take, there is also no sense in torturing yourself.

I hate seeing other people suffer.", "This is exactly what j krishnamurti says. I'm sry for what happened even though it doesn't change anything. The self which is created by thinking which is the past is responsible for all this. The division, me and you, my country not yours, divorces, hurting others, falling into the ilussion of individuality... He didn't love you in the first place. Having a self denies love, he loves ideas and beliefs and the sense of becoming someone when in fact is there is no one to become. He is just dead memories, the movement of that gives him the idea that he is living. But in actuality he lives in a virtual reality, he never loved, smelled, sensed beauty. His thoughts which are actually not his but of society cause we are the product of the bs and ilussions they sell us, love and sex, which is just pleasurable activity of the demand of thought to feel something.\nLove as we know it implies me and you. In that there is division, conflict therefore limited. All memory based, two entities, two images that are given the impression that they talk. But you don't know him, you think you love him. What you love is the image of his. All that is meaningless, no one can accept this harsh truth....we operate partially, only thinking(memory) operates. All other senses are dormant. How can there be love, a sense of union, something beyond thought, not falling in love but the sense of that energy when memory is active and thinking about myself, my problems, my job...\nCheck out j krishnamurti. It's really profound. There is nothing more meaningful in life than the truth. It's on YouTube. The truth is the real meaning which is what you said the life we live which is thinking is fundamentally meaningless and destructive. With all its beliefs, ilussions etc. I really doubt if there is real love anymore... So it's important to find out what is thinking in itself. \nKrishnamurti points out to some shocking facts.

The answer of meaning is a difficult one because it's hard to break down. But youre right there isn't a  \"THE meaning of life\" depending on who you ask the meaning of life is different. And it honestly means what you make it since everyone opinion is subjective. I wish my purpose was just handed to me at birth but unfortunately that's not the state of affairs. The fact that others have suffered much more than us is also a good way of reminding yourself it's not that bad. Consider that water heaters we're invented In 1970 and weren't ubiquitous til 1990, we have a personal hot Oasis whenever we need. I try to remind myself of the little things since so many before us suffered meaninglessly, at least we have the option to suffer meaningfully, I recommend find a hobbie.

You clearly have a lot to offer, and a lot to process. I know that my own condition has often been too much for some people to handle -  I have had to learn to accept that and forgive them, and me, so that I could continue to love them, and know that they continue to love me even though they don't have the necessary skills to deal with my depression. This is not uncommon. Keep trying, keep talking, and know that you are being heard and valued.

Don't let her take that from you.\nI do surely hope she fights this battle with you, because it is a hard battle.\n\nIn my case I found out my mom has battled depression for a long time, hers started around the same age as mine started. My mom's aunt struggles with depression. My mom has told me she didn't feel that close with her mother, but she said looking back she believes her mother struggled with it as well. Maybe it runs in your family too?", "I can give you some guidance here if you wish.  \n\nFirst, try to understand that most of us who deal with depression, have very good reasons for why we are depressed.  Many of those reasons, come from our parents and this very common mental condition called, \"Denial\".  Denial, is a strange thing, it is a lie that we tell ourselves and the more we convince ourselves, the sicker we become.  So, let me ask you this...  When you try to confront your mother about your feelings and beliefs, does she become defensive, tell you that is nonsense, accuse you of wasting time?  This type of defensive emotional response is the signature of denial, which is basically people trying to hide the things they are ashamed of.\n\nTry to accept her and find someone different, someone safe you can talk to.  There is a very good chance your mother is in denial and the more you try to get her to see your side, the more depressed you will become.  We cannot change someone else's mind, when they are in denial.  Accept her as she is and return the focus to doing things that bring you joy.  You may NEVER gain her approval, but you can certainly gain your own approval.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay my words have meaning for you, Namaste.", "Thank you, I appreciate this a lot.

"]}, {"tag": 50050, "question": "Hello Depression_Help,\n\nTLDR: I had an epiphany this weekend and I think I might be depressed and might have been feeling this way for a long time. I'm not really sure though, and could use some help and guidance.\n\n\n\nLate last week, my boyfriend (28M) of 3.5 years and I (31M) were watching tv and somehow we ended up having a very serious life talk. I don't want to get too heavy into specific details but he told me that for a while now he has felt like something changed between us and we went from being lovers to roommates. He said the romance and intimacy was gone and he didn't know if he wanted to continue being in a relationship with me. \n\nCurrently our libidos are not on the same level. His libido is much higher than mine. When we met, we had a very active sex life, and (I believe) we both enjoyed it a lot. He always had a higher libido than me but overtime I got less and less horny and it's gotten to the point where I'm rarely in the mood at all. This has been a big cause of hardship in our relationship over the last while. I can't even tell you when this decline happened but for a while my boyfriend was constantly making advances on me that I would turn down. It wasn't that I wasn't attracted to him, or that I wasn't interested in him, or anything like that. I just didn't feel like having sex. Sometimes it was that I didn't want to have full on sex, but would be ok with foreplay. Other times, I wasn't really in the mood for any of it. Some days even making out wasn't exciting to me and felt more like a chore. After so many denials, his attempts became less and less frequent. They dwindled to where it was clear he wasn't interested in sleeping with me anymore. \n\nWhen he made advances and I wasn't feeling sexual, I tried to spin the mood so we could still be intimate with each other. I'd want to cuddle or spoon or talk sweet nothings but I couldn't see that in that moment I was making him feel unwanted and undesired. While I wanted and desired him, I was unable to show that to him. \n\nThere were external factors that I believe contributed to (may or may not have caused?) a large drop in my libido. I had a series of injuries several months apart that did not leave me feeling in my prime. I was previously running 3-4 days a week and that had dropped to nothing. I was putting on weight due to inactivity and not changing/increasing my diet. I was unhappy with my body but chalked it up to low self confidence because I was gaining weight, not because I was sad. We've been making a conscious effort to change our diet and I've since lost 16lbs from my highest weight. I'm still ~25lbs heavier than when my boyfriend and I met in 2015.\n\nIn the past few months my boyfriend and I have had a couple of talks in regards to our different libidos. In the end, I always make a commitment to try and be more open to sex. These are never empty promises; I always intend to carry through. But somehow we have sex a few times and fall back into the same rut where I'm not feeling it. My boyfriend is no monster either. There have been times that I've offered to do it and he's turned it down because he knows that I'm not feeling it. He respects me a lot and he doesn't want to do it with me when i don't want to do it. Which leads us back to not doing it, and him being frustrated that we aren't doing it. \n\nOf the several things we have decided to try to make things work, we decided to have a somewhat-open relationship. We downloaded the sex apps and invited a few people over to our place to have fun times. My boyfriend even set up a few meeting with guys on his own. I set up one on my own during a time he was also out, and it didn't really do it for me. As I said before, I was still attracted to and interested in my boyfriend. I didn't want to have sex as often, but when I did want to have sex, it was with him. \n\nIn addition to our issues in the bedroom, my boyfriend made it clear that he thought I've been spending too much time around the house. In the past he has dropped little hints, like \"Why don't you message XXXXX or XXXXX and see if they want to do something tonight?\" My answer would always be the same \"Yeah, but I don't really feel like it.\" Now he was much more upfront about it. My boyfriend has reoccurring social obligations almost every weeknight (sports, etc.) and often plans on the weekend. I sometimes tag along to things with him to things that I can, but otherwise I'm always home. I still see my friends sometimes but not like I used to. One of the reasons my boyfriend joined some of the extra curricular activities he did was because I was always out doing things and he \"wanted something to do on Monday nights too!\" I've seem to have let all of that go by, and it has been a very long time that my boyfriend has been in our apartment alone. He told me that he has been feeling smothered by the fact that I'm always at home and he would appreciate more alone time in the apartment. \n\nWe decided on the weekend that we would try and do our own thing. He went to visit some family and I ended up having a 3 hour Skype convo with a friend who lives far away. After the call I was reflecting and it kind of hit me like an epiphany: Am I depressed? I had convinced myself, and unconvinced myself several times in a short period of time that I was, and wasn't, depressed. \n\nI don't struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I don't struggle to eat. I don't sit around thinking about how sad I am. But I can't even recall the last time I felt truly happy. I haven't really felt anything other than blase in a long time. So I don't really feel like I'm depressed. But then I look around and think about it and go \"oh yeah, I guess I have spent the last 21 nights in a row at home,\" or \"Yeah I guess I haven't seen one of my best friends in a few months and I can see her apartment from our window.\" Everything I seem to read lets me believe that I am depressed. But that is in contradiction to how I haven't been feeling sad or have not have suicidal thoughts. So I am so confused and I have no idea if I am depressed or if there is something else going on, and more importantly, I'm struggling to know where to go from here. \n\nAfter having this realization about myself, my boyfriend and I had a really good conversation about how I had no idea that I was even feeling this way. To me, it felt like I was living in a foggy bubble, and suddenly the bubble popped and I can see the world around me and I think WTF? If you had asked me a week ago if I was depressed I would have laughed and said no. Now I'm not so sure. \n\nAfter that talk, my boyfriend and I agreed to give things a chance. I love him more today than I did the day I met him and it's really beating me down to know how much I have been hurting him and how I haven't been showing him the love and intimacy and desire that I thought I was giving to him. I learned in this conversation that my boyfriend hasn't been feeling attracted to me as of late. Not because of my looks, but because of my personality. He says I'm not the same person I was when we met and he fell for me. \n\nI desperately want to be the fun and exciting person that I was when we met. I want to find the parts of me that I feel I've lost, and I want to feel like a strong individual with my own life, that is in a relationship, rather than feel like just the \"other half\".\n\nI'm so scared because I don't know where to go from here. I don't know where to find those parts of me that I lost. I don't know how to convince myself I want to go out and do things. I don't know how to rebuild the friendships that I've been neglecting. And I don't know how to work on myself and find that zest for life again. I know that if I can't find that zest, things won't work out between my boyfriend and I. And I want things to work out so badly. I love him more than anyone, and anything, and I'll do anything to keep him around. I know this is going to be hard and will take hard work. I'm willing to put in that hard work but I don't even know what that hard work is. I don't know where to start. \n\nMy boyfriend has suggested that I find an online therapist to talk to. He has an online therapist that he says has been very helpful. We both feel this approach is better for us than an in-person therapist both because of timing/scheduling, and and pricing. I'm committing myself to getting better and I want to take my boyfriends suggestion to heart. I've heard that it can often take people multiple therapists before they find the right one for them. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips for how to tell if the therapist you've been matched with is actually a good match for you? How do you know when it's time to \"move on\" to another therapist?\n\nI realize that I've just spewed a lot of word vomit and I'm sure it doesn't all make sense. But if anyone is still reading this (or reads it at all) I would love to know your thoughts and opinions on how I'm feeling and what you think could be going on? Do you think I'm depressed or is there something else going on with me? What do I do now?

Don\u2019t let it trick you into hiding it away. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with depression for years and have noticed a few things I want to share. \n\nIt seems to me that depression actively seeks to block us from the activities that will lessen its impact, like exercise, time with friends, spending time outdoors, creating art etc. \n\nIt seems to particularly attack people with powerful potential for positive impact, attempting to prevent them from doing good in this world. \n\nMore than simply a personal emotional issue, it sometimes feels like a spiritual battle on a metaphysical level....an attack on the light by the powers of darkness.  Seeing it this way can be inspiring for me:  \u201cI am a potentially powerful tool for positivity in this world, and that\u2019s why I am being attacked by these aberrant negative thoughts.\u201d\n\nWhen I am depressed, I make a valiant attempt do the things your depression tells you not to do. It *will* help. \n\nRemember that *everything* depression tells you is a fucking lie.  A cognitive distortion. \nYou are loved. You are valuable. You are worthy of happiness and good things. \nEveryone makes mistakes, but everyone can change.  Today is a new day.  Go do better. \n\nSeek each day to find one thing you\u2019re grateful for.   Reach out to a friend who loves you. Be of service to someone else. \n\nIt helps me the most to remember that *I am not my distorted thoughts*. I am the quiet center, the Seat of Consciousness inside that *listens* to my thoughts. The quiet center is always at peace until I allow my emotions to be disturbed by these thoughts.  Meditation can help discern the difference between the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d and the quiet center. \n\nAs Victor Frankl observed, \u201cthere is a space between stimulus and response. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\u201d\n\nI have learned that emotions follow thoughts.  I find it very helpful to understand this fact.  It helps me identify the distorted negative thoughts and deny them before the emotional reaction begins. \n\nThe next time you have a distorted negative thought, ask yourself \u201cwould my best friend tell me this?  Would I say this to them?\u201d and if it doesn\u2019t pass that test, push back and argue against it. Don\u2019t embrace the lies it is telling you.

One Google search can find you plenty to go off of (I apologise for not being able to link anything right now, I'm on mobile and pressed for time).\n\nFor now, treat it like it is depression, because even if it's not, recovery strategies should still provide much relief. If you're so inclined, do talk to a professional later, especially if you've been trying self-help for a while and nothing seems to be working.

Therapy is another option that can be particularly effective as well.

But when external factors, such as what you're going through, are causing the depression, you may want to try seeing a therapist before trying any meds. Talking to a therapist feels weird at first but when I found one that I really \"clicked\" with, it started feeling more like talking to a best friend.

There's no rule against it. Depression tends to make jobs more difficult to do, but it also can teach you how to preserver.\n\nYou feel like shit now, and it's ok. It can be difficult to look beyond academics when you and everyone around you are focused on it, but life is way more than grades and acceptance letters, and it's ok to fail. In the end, people who never fail are the ones who will break when shit really hits the fan later on in life, because they haven't yet learnt that they are fallible.\n\nYou're allowed to feel like crap about this, but don't let some institutions determine what you are worth. They don't know shit about you aside from some superficial details. Look into other fields of study, like science, business or anything, really. Maybe take a gap year and do something a little odd, like charity work or travelling. Think of your life more like hiking trails than a checklist of things you must do, and it becomes far easier to deal with this sort of thing.

I am from Singapore and I face, and faced, the exact same problem as you. And I intend to let myself face it again. \n\nLike you, I've obtained straight As in A levels. I masked my pain, my depression, my self harm, my suicidal tendencies. I applied everywhere, not only to medicine. I applied for scholarships and the likes, and I got rejected from everywhere. 8 total rejections.  Almost everyday I ask myself if I'm flawed. I ask myself if I'm never good enough. I dread finding out through my life that I will never be good enough. \n\nIt is painful. I want to end it all too. I'm tired.\nBut is it worth it ?\nSometimes I see it as, they don't recognise the goods. They made a mistake. Not you. They made a fatal mistake that's going to cost them something bigger in the future. \n\nWhy would I say so ? Because of the people I known who made it in, they are the worst kind of people. Horrendous personalities, hypocrites. These are not possible to detect in a few rounds of so called psycho analysis or MMIs. \n\nIs it worth ending your precious life because of such people who have taken your spot ? I'd say no.\n\nYou tried your best and you failed. I tried my best and failed. I tried to so many places and failed. Does it mean I'm more flawed than you ? Should I therefore defenestrate myself ? \n\nNo my dear. And you should not end yourself. \n\nI quote, a post that I copied to my clipboard, from local forums. To clarify, NUS and NTU are the universities in Singapore with medical schools.\n\n\"If you are really keen on doing medicine after the rejection, there are ways to do it such as doing it overseas or post-grad. But like what someone has said above, doing medicine is overrated and just because you got rejected from nus/ntu eventually doesn't mean that you are not good enough to do medicine; it's just the way things are.\u00a0\n\nIf you can't afford studying overseas, then suck it up and do something else first and if you still want to pursue it, you can surely do it the post-grad way after working a few years.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would like to stress that rejection from nus/ntu doesn't mean that you are not cut out to be a doctor but think hard about whether the long medical training inclusive of undergrad and postgrad is worth the time and effort or not.\n\nAgreed, please don't think that you are no good just because you got rejected from these schools because to be honest, it is very difficult for the admissions committee to tell if someone is really suited for medicine or not just from a few rounds of interviews/MMI/\"psycho-analysis\". Tonnes of people that were made for medicine were rejected in the years before you and conversely tonnes of people whom\n are not cut out to be doctors got in.\u00a0\"\n\nThank you for taking time to read this.

I have some good times (not manic, only one point in my life when i was, just feeling naturally okay) and the other times are like.. well depressed. I wasn't on meds and tbh i didnt stop taking them bc i felt better, i stopped when i wasnt great and i just was sick and tired of taking meds. I did get better though. For awhile.\n\nBut now im bad again. This is the literally worst time ever. It started off slow, i had a vague feeling of depression that would come whenever and usually leave within an hour. The vague feeling became really bad. And then it kind of turned into a mild depression and an all the time feeling of i want to kill myself. And then i got super depressed.\n\nIt was to the point of i almost killed myself. I was sitting in the back yard with my dogs one day and i was crying so hard and i had to force myself to stay outside even though i was freezing. Before when i was suicidal it was more of a classic \"i wanna turn a switch and be dead\" or \"i dont wanna wake up in the morning\". But this time is more serious. Like i was sitting in my room that same day and i was about to wanting to and i just like was thinking of a way of doing it.\n\nI told my family. It wasnt more of a telling as it was a lashing out and yelling and crying. And anyways for 6 days i was chronically suicidal. A general feeling of it felt weird to still be living. It was to the point i had to do laundry i havent done it in like 2 months. And i did it all and cleaned my room. But i dunno. I feel like i keep losing my goddamn shit.\n\nIm feeling like im at the end of my rope. I was feeling suicidal again. And it occured to me i feel at the end of my rope. I really have no \"light at the end of the tunnel\". I dont have anything at all lol. Like.. j feel like the therapy and meds arent enough. I wanna go inpatient but i cant afford it and no one else can. And im not talking a short stay im thinking  AT LEAST 2 weeks until however long i need. \n\nI wanted to talk to my medium but i cant. One she hasnt replied two i am unemployed and couldnt afford it. (Dont say get a job itll help if i could i would, life gets complicated). But idk i have talked to her before and she said all these things without me saying or hinting at anything at all, so id trust her if she said anything abt my future at all. Ig i just need a confirmation or anything at all. She gave me her number and added me.on facebook. She has read my messages and no reply. \n\nIm not mad or anything im just at my end. My dogs whoni love piss me off so easily and they never do. My brother is playing a game and the noise is so annoying, him talking abt the tv is, him hiccuping. \n\nIf you ever kept reading this all the way through. Thank you.

I feel like my world is collapsing (plus some personal things from childhood and puberty)\n\nI am female, 21, and a university student. I am depressed for ~9-10 years now. Im from germany (sorry about my english btw) and 10 years ago after elementary school, here in germany we change schools and get sorted into 3 possible schools. I lost all my old classmates in that process. The class i got was shitty, i hated the school and i hated the people, so i avoided them and became a good bullying target. My answer to that was dissociation, and i lost myself in a fantasy world (it now helps me to draw, make art, character design and to write stories though). But ever since then i was depressed. I had my first therapist when i was 14, and after a few months i got transfered to another one because my mother found stories i wrote where i fantasized about suicide. I did not visit him more than twice though because i did not like him, and noone could make me go there because i said it was just a story i wrote and made up.\n\nI got my a-levels when i was 18, i wasnt even that bad, and i had my second (big) depressed episode when i went to my first university. I hated that one as well, and the first days reminded me of the first days of my new school. So i did not go there anymore and got my third therapist i still visit now. My best friend had a similar course of study, and the university he visited wasnt only closer, but i also liked it better. So i transfered. And it was a good decision. The first semester was really stressfull, but i did not fail a single exam and i was even good at it (no idea how). The first time after 9 years when i walked into my uni i did not feel like screeming. I remember that feeling of entering my old schools vividly, as if every single mm of my body would want to screem, as if my cells would turn around by themselfs and run away and tear me apart. For the first time that feeling was gone, and although i was stressed i felt better, i baked cookies for christmas, i started to wear an old bracelet during winter and i sometimes even liked getting up and wearing a cute skirt (i normally look like the perfect stereotype lesbian (i mean i am...). Short hair, quite masculine clothing... But i started to sometimes even like my skirt) I felt almost fine for a few weeks. \n\nIm in third semester now, and the second one was ... Rough. I had mental breakdowns. My anxiety about exams increased drastically(and before writing them i was in pure panic, i did not even feel anxious anymore i was just numb), and i had mental breakdowns from time to time. The summer is fucking cold in germany and the weather is shit, and it always was an issue for me, but at least it WAS summer. I did not fail my exams again, although my grades were way worse and one was pretty close. \n\nDuring the break i went traveling two times, and it was increadible. We went to italy (i will always love italy) and just looking at the deep blue ocean made me so calm. Thinking about germany though and how i had to leave again triggered something. During the end of the summer and the beginning of autumn i had a few panic attacks. I couldnt control them, it felt like i suddenly was falling, then it stopped, only to start again. It felt like waves. My stress level was rising, sometimes in the evening i could feel how my nerves went insane, as if i would shiver, but my body didnt move. The semester began, and it was harder and harder to get up in the morning. With each week i started to be afraid of the morning, i did not sleep anymore which obvsly made it worse. Before christmas my therapist got me some pills to sleep better and gave me tips to relax, now its a little bit better. But at the end of the christmas hollidays, i started to feel worse. I counted the days until university started as if it was my date of death. I need to prepare for my exams, i have them in less than a month, but i just cant. \n\nYesterday was the first day of uni, and i felt surprisingly well at first. I could think straight, i could do my exercises... It was fine. At home i was so tired though, i went straight to bed and slept almost the entire day. I even overslept my gym. Now today went as i expected it. I couldnt think, i was tired (i slept enough), and since we practiced old exams which i couldnt solve i was in panic again. I knew when i come home i need to sleep, which i planned to do so, so i can do my exercises and study later in the evening. So i went straight to bed, until my friend told me that i need to cancel my therapist this week (we have a one time project there). Now the thing is, i need her this week since she needs to write another doctor (not involved with my mental health, but important for me personally. I want and need this to be done as quick as possible, its too much to explain now though) who wrote me an email that he needs her confirmation. I just wrote my therapist if its possible to reschedule, but we need to cancel it since she is full. And im just... Im really really done now. Just completely done with life. I knew she wouldnt reschedule bc shes always full, and when my friend told me to write her i already had a breakdown. I grabbed a chair in my room and threw it on the floor, now one leg is broken, and i did not answer any messages from my quite concerned and worried friend so far. I just dont know what to do anymore. After my breakdown i wrote my therapist and she said she has no time. I broke down in tears again and i still cry. It took hours now and its long dark outside (not that this was something special in this shithole of german winter), i havent done any exercises so far, i cant go to the gym anymore, and my headache from crying will probably last a bit and i can surely not focus right now. I lost one full day where i had time, and my friend who is in my study group probably as well and its my fault. Tomorrow i will be at uni past 5pm for useless bullshit noone needs (communication and i study maths... Like wtf whyyy), i will loose another day. The day after tomorrow i will have my project which takes the whole day as well, so thats again, another lost day. I feel like everything is collapsing. Whenever i plan something important, there is always something in the way so it fails. I cant plan my days how i want them because the things i nees to do are interfering, i am rushing from one thing to the other and i dont know how to keep it up anymore. Im so tired, im so done with everything, i just dont want to end this. My friend sais he fears i develop burnout syndromes, and i am a bit afraid since he always seems to have a sixth sence for whats wrong with me. He sometimes just sais whats wrong when i dont even know myself yet. And im worried hes right now. \n\nI dont know how to end this, i could just go on and write unconnected things, but i think ill just stop here. If anyone read through this, first thank you for taking your time to read my wall of text, second i dont expect anyone to provide a solution since not even my therapist can so far.

I am 16 and I have dealt with depression for about 2 years now and have been diagnosed with anxiety for 7, although I have faced it almost my whole brief life. I'm not sure why I am depressed and I know my life isn't the worst but I will compact it. From grade 2 to grade 7, I was bullied. In the earlier years it was for my anger issues, having no friends, and being overweight. For the later years it was for being gay. I had childhood friends and they all moved away and I haven't had a best friend or friends for 3 years. Last year, I attempted suicide after all my friends ditched when I told them I was dealing with a lot and need support, they also told everyone I was lying for attention. Everyone I have known has talked behind my back, as I would say something and they would tell people without me knowing and promise they wouldn't. An example would be in grade 5 I told my best friend I had feelings for a guy, and she told him and his friends, prompting them to bully me. Secondly, I have done things I am not proud of and will never forgive myself for, things that I honestly can't mention when really they might not be that bad to anyone. My depression is worsened by the fact that my mom, and grandma are suicidal, and my sister was abused by her boyfriend and went through attempts of suicide too. I eat lunch with a teacher everyday and whenever I make any interaction with people my anxiety makes me embarrass myself and people usually laugh at me, and everyday I go home attempt homework but end up sleeping around 6 or staying up laying in bed doing absolutely nothing just laying still until 11. I am smart over 90's all the time, but it is all I have and people are usually mad at me because they are jealous maybe, but I have no social life and school is all I have to live for.

I am too anxious and actually scared of how hard a job or university will be to the point that I don't want to do it, I won't have friends, I am really awkward and not funny and nobody will ever love me and even if they did I picture love differently and am actually scared of sex, or worried that maybe the person I love doesn't really love me and will cheat, because they like sex more than they love me. I have almost completely stopped feeling, no video games, music, books or anything make me happy and I truly feel like there is no more reason to live. I am also worried of failing in the future because my parents don't have money and need me to help them live, my mom specifically said I need to get a scholarship or else I cant go to university because we don't have the money and I don't want to let anyone down. My anxiety has stopped me 3 times from seeing a psychiatrist, I am just to anxious to talk to people and I won't be able to open up, I can't and I really just want to be put on medication, but my doctor has kept saying I need to see a counselor or psychiatrist before getting medication.

Thank you", "I guess I can relate a bit to you. I'm 22 now, but when I was younger, even younger than you, I had suffered bullying a lot because I was a nerd, weird and well, kids called me ugly a lot. I had a big problem with acne, wore glasses and braces, so yeah. Definitely not the most popular kid. Also didn't had much friends, was too shy and scared of talking to people, as I always felt that I would say the wrong thing and be awkward. Things did get better as I grow up, specially in college, when I learned some social skills and become a bit more confident in myself.  \nI don't know if it will help, but as I was reading your post, I remembered something a guy told me once. He was also depressed, but the reason why he wouldn't give up on his life was not cause he was positive, but because he \"wanted to bet on it\" (I don't really know how to translate the correct expression to english, english is not my original language lol hope it's correct). He was 28 and still felt young, he thought it was worth seeing where life would lead him. And, in a way, I guess I agree with him. It also remembers me of something I read on this subreddit, it was someone saying that death is a certain and definitive thing, but life is not. \nWhat I'm trying to say is, you never know how your future may turn out to be. When I was being bullied and sad, I thought of dying and really wished to die. But now that I look back, I guess it would be really sad, because I would miss a lot of important and big experiences that happened later. Don't get me wrong, I am depressed, still. But I feel happy when I remember the friends I made along the way, the guys I fell in love with, the great conversations I had, the new things I tried. These are things I really treasure. You're so young, you know, so maybe stick around here for more time. Depression is tough, people can disappoint you, but there might be one or two things that make life worth.\nI hope you find a way of dealing better with your pain and problems. My way was looking for a therapist and I'll also see a psychiatrist next week. Don't feel bad about being anxious cause of psychiatrists, I also tried to avoid as much as possible, I was very scared of trying meds. Maybe it'll take a while before you get the courage as well, maybe you will find another type of treatment.

I am also glad that you say it is normal to be anxious to see a psychiatrist at first and it will take time, because I know other people feel this and have to get overcome it too, but once they do it gets better.

This stuff is tough on your own.", "ITT: Great communication."]}, {"tag": 50084, "question": "I\u2019m a 16 year old lad in Year 12. Ever since i was in primary school I always had trouble keeping up with the other kids in my classes when it comes to work. Even during my GCSEs I was given extra time for both my coursework and my exams. Even to this day as I\u2019m starting my level 3 BTEC course in Music Performance. While I enjoy playing the drums to help me pass this course, it also requires a lot of work that needs typing up.\n\nThe three hours I get every weekday to work, I easily get distracted when I am working during class time - even when the class is silent and I\u2019m not talking constantly to my friends. I constantly brush this problem aside too often with the common \u201cI can do it at home\u201d excuse, but the truth is every time I plan on doing work, I reschedule it with something else to make myself feel better such as playing games or watching a film. Eventually, I usually run out of time during the day to do work and I decide on whether or not to stay up until stupid o\u2019clock to make some progress on my work (which is still nowhere near completion and nearly 2 weeks overdue). Even when I do stay up to do work, I spend more time staring at the screen, into space or I distract myself by watching a youtube video, for example. In the end I make minimal progress but even then I praise myself to make myself feel better, which I later on think is pathetic. I\u2019m in an endless cycle of starting the day, wanting to get this work done and then wasting my time on something that will get me nowhere before realising I have ran out of time for the day to do any work. It happens more and more to the point where the things I do that distract me from work make me less and less entertained, yet I still do them. The fact that this happens too much makes me feel like this work is never going to get done no matter what I do. Every time I try and do some work I have no drive to do it, regardless of how hard the work is.\n\nEven if I do manage to get all my work done and I get this qualification, I have no idea what to do with it; I have no particular aspiration or dreams about what to do for a living. I\u2019ve thought too often whether or not I am depressed or any sort of mental disorder. I am too scared to get myself tested because I worry about how my parents will react, and I worry if it will all be for nothing and that I\u2019m fine. I have great friends who know I am struggling to focus on work but I\u2019ve never spoken to them about how desperate my lack of drive and motivation makes me question whether or not I am mentally ill, as I fear I will look stupid and they will just tell me I\u2019m lazy.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if a lot of this looks like a complete waffle, but it\u2019s been on my mind too often recently, and I\u2019m writing this late at night. I just need somewhere to vent about this because it\u2019s taking over me", "answer": ["Hey, don't worry about it.  Thanks for reaching out.\n\nHonestly, we can't tell you if you're depressed.  What you are experiencing sounds quite typical, to be honest.  I don't mean to belittle your experience, instead I want just to show that you aren't alone.  People experience this lack of motivation in various parts of their lives, for varying reasons.  Your case is unique, especially because it is happening to you.  But you also, are not alone.\n\nSo, you have some reasons to be stressed.  School isn't the perfect environment for you to thrive, but you seem to enjoy being a drummer.  (sorry, I'm not familiar with the British? school system)  You... procrastinate.  That is... human.  Your subconscious (let's call it that) would rather distract you than experience the pain of dealing with your stress head on.  This is a defense mechanism.  But it's also a mechanism that is making things worse.  You have acknowledged that as well.\n\nMy first piece of advice to you, is Don't Do It Alone!  It's the first step you can take.  Start your work when you are at school.  You might be embarrassed at first, but in the long run it will be good for you.  We can't avoid embarrassing things forever, well you could, but some of the best things in life come from us embarrassing ourselves over and over again (love, for example).  If you start your work at school, you won't be able to stare off into your screen.  You will be closer to your teachers and they will be more willing to help you.  Or ask somebody to study with you.  You will get rejected and you will get embarrassed, but goddammit try it again until you work something out.  The social factor keeps you from becoming a shut in and letting your waffle lizard brain decide what to do.\n\nNext...  introduce some structure into your life.  Why do nuns pray?  Is it to worship?  To purify their souls?  No, it's because the prayer bell rang.  Making decisions takes willpower, and when you are fighting depression and procrastination willpower is limited.  What structure does is it lets you delegate the decision making to the schedule.  You have a certain amount of time each day, at a certain place, you are doing your work.  And you make it sacred.  Something you do according the schedule.  Terry Crews used this technique, he has a schedule to go to the gym.  If he had a terrible day, he still goes to the gym.  He might not work out while he's there, but at least he always goes.  So it's never a fight to be there, he just is.  And look how jacked the man is.  So, maybe you have a study buddy now, maybe not, but you have a time you go to the library and you work.  Maybe choose the computer spot where everybody walking by can see what you're working on, so you aren't tempted to waste time.  But if you do, hey, you're at the library brainiac, pick up a book.\n\nOther things to consider:  Novelty (going someplace new to work), energy (are you eating and sleeping right?), control (is your life absolutely crazy?).  A therapist could help you stick with a behavioral program like the above, help you learn the skills you need to be the person you want to be.  It's not your fault you don't know them yet, in fact I'm impressed you are asking for help rather than burying your head in the sand.  And, then, the behavioral approach isn't enough, then maybe you have a neurological issue (depression or ADHD?) and you need a medical boost.  And even then, the medicine works much better with behavioral accountability.  Otherwise with depression you're miserable with your mood enhanced, or with ADHD you're suddenly really focused at doing things that don't help you.\n\nDoes that help a little?"]}, {"tag": 50085, "question": "People who didn\u2019t know you had depression, or weren\u2019t sure, what tipped you off?

", "You know what, me neither. I think I'm depressed, but I'm not sure. I don't know why I desire to diagnose what I'm feeling so badly. I think stating that \"I'm depressed\" gives you a sense of closure.\n\nSo by all means, if you think you're depressed, you may as well be depressed. Please don't let it get the best of you, though.\n\nPersonally, I don't seek attention at all. I just tell myself I'm depressed as a way to describe my constant state of being lonely, having zero motivation, and not wanting to exist, but sticking in there for some reason.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that if you diagnose yourself as depressed, make it mean something to you. Find the help you need, a community, and support. I found someone near me (they're technically a therapist), and they've really helped me.\n\n(Side note that you can always get yourself diagnosed by a professional, but keep in mind that some doctors can be wack.)", "For me, I felt similarly until I realized that most people *don\u2019t want to die*. Even though you don\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it, I\u2019m assuming you still really wish you could. I needed this realization to be able to see my situation objectively: that people who legitimately want to die for an extended period of time need help and therefore I should probably get help. \nAlso, it seems that your thinking on this is a bit distorted: yes many people of our age group talk about how they want to die and such. But I think for a lot of them, it\u2019s just because they\u2019re in a tough situation, which is reasonable. But if you\u2019re feeling this way, like, most of the time, and not just when you\u2019re going through a temporarily rough time, yes I\u2019d guess that you have something deeper going on. Especially because you want a bit of a push to get yourself to do it- I feel the same way pretty often. I think I was in your situation not too long ago, so feel free to pm me if you have more questions, or just want to talk :)", "In my experience if you think you might be doing/feeling something for attention and feel guilty about it, that means that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a sort of internalized defense mechanism maybe? Like, I\u2019m not actually feeling this I just need attention therefore everything is fine and I\u2019m fine I just need to get over it, sort of attitude. Take a second to acknowledge how you feel and validate it. Honestly, with depression, recognizing you\u2019re emotions is a really good step. ", "So do you sometimes feel ok? Temporarily? Maybe when you\u2019re distracted, just got good news, or something like that? Or should it be most of the time to be classified as depression? I don\u2019t know why I want to give what I feel a name, maybe because if everyone really does feel like this but not everyone reacts the way I do that means I\u2019m just weak. And btw thanks for seeming to care about me more than my friends do I really appreciate it.", "It\u2019s sort of hard to say, because every depressive episode I\u2019ve had that I can remember has felt slightly different. Like a lot of the time, yeah, if I\u2019m distracted by my friends, I feel okay and not really be thinking about dying or whatever. It would just be when I was alone or in my head a lot when I would feel really badly.\n\nBut then also, quite recently, for me it\u2019s changed a bit so that even when I feel sort of good in a way, the weight of the feeling would still be very noticeable in the background, so it\u2019s just 24/7. But normally the answer would be yes: distractions would definitely make me feel alright.\n\nA question that you may want to ask yourself is: if you look back at the past couple weeks or so, has this feeling truly affected your quality of life? Has it affected the decisions you make, and how you interact with the people around you? If the answer is yes, (which from what I\u2019ve read about you it seems to me it is,) then it\u2018s very likely that it\u2019s an issue that deserves to be treated in some way.\n\nAnd yeah, I understand the feeling of wanting to know whether or not to classify it as depression. I suppose being diagnosed proves that, it really is a disease that can be treated, rather than just your personality that you have to live with.\n\nNo problem :) a few redditors have given me a great deal of help when I was still in your position, so I\u2019m more than happy to pass on the good deed.

I think I have been depressed for about 3 months but I'm really not sure, I wasn't popular at school but I had a good social life and good friends, when I got to uni at first I loved it, but after a while I started to realise maybe my friends weren't completely my type of people. I also was not having much of a love life, I have never been hugely prolific but mist people improve their love life at university. I was comparing my experience with my friends who went to other universities and it was getting me down.\nBy the time second year came around I started self medicating with weed, I was smoking every day, I would wake up feeling empty and alone, despite the fact I had a girlfriend that year, but by about 4 o'clock that day I would be completely numbed by weed.

I did exactly the same thing and just about scraped a pass. I became convinced that I the root of all my problems was the weed, and that that was the reason I was lazy and didnt give a shit about anything, So for my this year I decided to quit.

Trust me I think you\u2019ll like it a lot. ", "Alright, So I see you're going through a lot of problems, and they will each take some work to get through. Let's start with, I am also failing uni right now. So, first things first, you need to talk with a school advisor and let them know what you are going through, how school is going right now for you, and that you don't want to be doing this, but you're having problems (I also need to do this right now). I get just trying to work on happiness but then the anxiety of not dealing with it and it isn't going to get better without dealing with it. Time to put on our big people pants (and I'm not trying to be condescending I need to do the exact same thing). You need to tell them so then they can start to work with you on how to maybe not screw up royally and see what you can do about this semester. They may or may not recommend you to a school counselor who may be able to help you with the emotional problems you are having. Maybe there is a university clinic where you can see a doctor. They may give you something to help with your symptoms, anxiety, inability to sleep, etc. This is only a band aid, temporarily making it easier to cope however. The reasons you are having these problems need to be dealt with. If you can't talk to a counselor to unload your issues, do you have a friend you are closest with out of your friends? I know men are supposed to be \"strong, don't cry, not have emotional issues and struggles like this, and if you are, you absolutely can not talk about it!\" Unfortunately, this is the toxic masculinity of our culture that causes men to not deal with their emotional issues and discuss it with their male friends. Sometimes you'd be surprised what happens when you bring something like this up with your friends. Some are likely to be having the same issues, they just don't talk about it. It's up to you if you want to start that conversation though, and who with. Maybe a sibling if you have one? Another option might be to go to the library and get some books related to the issues you are having. Brene Brown's, Daring Greatly might be an option. And something related to anxiety and/or depression. Reading might be a good place to start if you'd rather not voice it to others at the moment. A huge thing when people get to college, is after a while they start comparing themselves to their peers, socially, and academically. It is not a good thing to do, speaking from experience. You have to try hard and learn to not compare yourself to others but rather attempt to become a better you. Focusing on yourself, and increasing self-esteem/self-confidence is way more important. Fuck others accomplishments when you're trying to work on your own. You do you whatever way is right for you. Know for me it took years to achieve, but it's something important to do. I can't really say much about the relationship and weed stuff you mention. I don't have experience with weed, although alcohol is something I've used to numb myself it the past. Of course it's not good, you're not facing your problems. But I understand just trying to cope with life in the moment. Having a short goal to look for in the future and work towards might be something. Pick one goal that is something you need and want, and is a short term goal for bettering yourself in the moment, and focus on getting to that point. I know you don't want to hear this but sex is not the be all end all. Don't get me wrong, it's great, and it definitely makes me lose focus sometimes and not allow me to concentrate without it, however, you don't have to compete with people, and you don't have to be a member of the no fap group. Take care of yourself, you know? Also, it's healthy for you, science says, so.. there. And maybe get some reading on being codependent? Not saying you are, I don't know anything about you, just coming up with ideas. I hope at least one thing I've said might help if what I've said is all a bunch of malarkey.

I finally admitted to myself that I am depressed again. I have been struggling with depression all of my life. I can remember having very strong symptoms of untreated depression when I was a kid. The anger, wild emotional responses to any sort of stimulus, feelings of hopelessness, feeling that I lacked control. I don't know if my mother ever caught on to it. I'm pretty sure she struggles with depression too, although I've never asked.\n     I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. Once I was given the diagnoses and I learned what the symptoms were, I realized that I have had this disease since I was very young. It went unnoticed and untreated, so I knew right off of the bat that it was going to be a long struggle for me.\n     I have a chronic brain disease, and it's called depression. It is trying to isolate me from people. It wants me to stay in my house and lay in bed for hours, willing myself to move. It wants me to chase everyone in my life away. It's telling me that I don't deserve help. But I don't want depression to win this time. My disease is not as sneaky as it used to be.\n     I just moved (which is a huge trigger for anyone) to a new state and started a new school. Basically, everything is new and I don't have people. I did, but all of my people live in other states now. I'm trying to plan out what people I need without overwhelming myself. I need my workout buddy. I need someone who will encourage me to get outside and move. Running, lifting, anything. \n     I need my study buddy. Studying is so overwhelming sometimes, and just having a person there, even if they are silent the whole time helps. It is comforting knowing that someone else is working alongside you.\n     I need my healthy person. You know that person that just oozes natural hippie health? They just have this way about them, and they always know herbal tea that will help with this and the recipe full of such and such nutrients. I LOVE these people. And I need one. All of the stress and anxiety that I have been experiencing has wreaked havoc on my stomach. One of the most forgotten symptoms of depression is gastric distress without a specific cause that doesn't go away with medicine. I need to heal my insides. They always hurt.\n        I need my meditation buddy. They help you keep you calm. They have these gentle spirits that make you want to be like them.\n     I need work buddies. The ones that make you laugh when work is tough.\n     I need my adventure buddy. That one person who always knows what is going on in town. They are the life of the party and you always have a good time with them.\n     Most of all, I need professional help. I can't do this by myself. I have tried more than once to \"cure\" myself. But I can't. I feel like so many people like us feel like we don't need to go to someone about depression because it's \"just a mood thing\" or because \"it's caused by hormone swings\". We assume that if we wait long enough it will just magically disappear. But it wont. We don't wait for ear infections to just go away. We go to the doctor and we get help making it go away. Then we help ourselves by using preventative measures, like cleaning our ears properly after a swim. When we get the flu, we don't wait around for it to go away. We don't want to be incapacitated by a sickness that will go away quicker if we go get help from a doctor. We get medicine, we learn how to prevent it, and then we change habits. Why isn't it the same with depression? I need help. I will beat this disease faster with help. I will be given tools that I didn't know were available to me. Once I get the professional help that I need, I will start using my preventative measures, like expanding my support system and I will start changing habits. But first, I need help from a doctor.\n    Even if no one reads everything here, I needed to say it. This post is for me. If anyone else is positively affected by this, that is a very happy plus.\nTD:LR\n   I have depression. It's coming back full swing. I need friends and I need help.", "answer": ["Be brave my friend.

Go [check out my website](http://tth.tips). I share a lot of practical, step-by-step ways to deal with this kind of stuff. I'm not a fan of teaching people to \"cope\" as much as teaching them how to conquer, so first comes acknowledging that winning is possible. I also write about this stuff on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Banip-qHksY/).\n\nThe BIGGEST problem with mental struggles is they convince us that everything we think and feel is true. There's a difference between thoughts and feelings being REAL, and thoughts and feelings being TRUTH. A lot of the reason people are defeated by these issues is because they don't know how to distinguish between the two. So when a thought or feeling says something negative in a matter-of-fact tone, \"You're worthless\" or \"You'll never be successful!\", the person immediately, even if just for a split second, accepts that as **truth**. Then a downward spiral and wicked cycle of sadness, anxiety and complete loss of identity has free reign to trample us because in our agreement we've given it permission. Oh, it'll sometimes let up, giving us just enough of a break to think it's left for good and we're \"over it,\" then, like the wicked devil it is, it comes back even worse than the time before, making us feel afraid to have hope of being \"cured\" because every time we think we are, there it is to prove us wrong.\n\nFUCK THAT THING.\n\nThe way to kick its ass is to learn who you are, then stick to that with a stubborn and obnoxious insistence. To everyone else you might sometimes seem to border on the line of denial. \"Are you blind? Look around!\" But you're not living by outside opinions of inside feelings, you're learning to live on that truth of identity established deeper than any of it. Setting that solid foundation is KEY if you don't want this thing to keep taking wins over you.\n\nI exist to help people in your situation get that kind of foundation established, so I hope you'll take a bit to go through and read some of what I've written!"]}, {"tag": 50089, "question": "Hello,\n\nEveryday I am suffering and just wanting to die. My pain is so unreal that it makes me sick and so hard to wake up everyday. I am 22 years old and have been in therapy since I was 6, took medicine since I was 7, and been put in treatment centers from 13+. My family convinced me to go into treatment last year, so I did. It didn't help and they sent me the bill when it was my family who put me there. My father refuses to pay my bill and says I should make payments on it even though he said he was going to pay it, as he said the same on my college bill, which he never did. So, I am 22 years old filled with already bad credit. \nOh, there is more. The reason why I am depressed is because when I was small, my father and mother had a horrible divorce and I was being molested by my grandfather from ages 3-13 years old. I told my mother, but she told me to stay away from him to just drop me off at his house everyday. I let this go on until I was 13 and couldn't take it anymore and knew it was going to get worse. Sometimes, I would offer him to touch me so he would give my sister food since he hated her. He got put in jail, but committed suicide in jail, so I never got justice for my abuse. I have nightmares every night. When my Grandfather died, my mother called me, my father and my step mother up and called us all murderers. Three weeks later, my Grandmother died from Ovarian cancer.\nWhen I was 16/17, I was in a school for kids with depression and was making progress in my recovery, for my dad and my step mom to send me to live back with my mom because they found old pills from years ago hiding in my pillow case because they were old depression medicine that made me sick and didn't help me. They made me puke, pass out out of nowhere, or made me really jittery and shake really badly. So, I am sent to live with my mother who had a shrine of my Grandfather on the top of her couch.\nI then started to date guys online that were inappropriate for me from being high ages than me because I just wanted a fatherly figure in my life. I just wanted a dad that loved me. My dad was always so distant and logical and never shown me emotion. Even hugging him was awkward. Then, I found this guy who is now my fiance. He is around my age because I decided I can't live those unhealthy age distance relationships. He made me so happy and my heart feel so warm. The only fault is that he lives in Trinidad and I live in the states, but we are planning for him to come live in the states with me, well I still think we are. A LOT of my happiness relies on him because nothing really brings me enjoyment anymore. I used to resort to anime or gaming when I am most down, but that doesn't even work anymore. I just recently moved in with HIS cousins in Florida and I have no one to cry to. I never want to press my problems on his family. Now, out of nowhere yesterday he blew up at me saying he hates how I am sometimes. I have bad habit of getting really angry at games and always feel I need to put in the last word because I never got justice in the past so I believe I am the only person who can bring justice for myself, so I feel this need to stick up for myself all the time. Now, he won't even speak to me and my heart is breaking. I feel I have nothing to make me happy anymore. I feel so broken. My brain and heart keep telling me to \n\"Kill yourself, _____.

I lost someone I considered a true friend because she couldn\u2019t accept that I have depression. She was my maid of honour, so you can imagine how much of a dear friend she was.\n\n\nBut that afternoon on my terrace in my hometown I didn\u2019t see a friend. I saw a stranger. But before I tell you more about this story, I need to tell you who she is as a person, and what I was when we were studying in the same class in high school\u2026\n\n\nI studied in a very prestigious school - the best in the country. But unlike other systems around the world, back home it didn\u2019t matter how much money you have as it is a public school and you enter by passing really hard exams. Competition was fierce. But I did it. And it took a lot. In fact, so much that I couldn\u2019t start the year in my new school because I got seriously ill. It was basically possible that I could die.\n\n\nAnyway, I went to school after 4 months pass the beginning of the school year and I managed to catch up and make friends. I was always an A student. I was among the smartest in the school and all teachers loved me. As you can imagine, my friend, let\u2019s call her Liz, only saw me at my best. Liz was another one of the smartest. I always admired her - super intelligent, ambitious, beautiful, resourceful, speaking 3 languages at the age of 16 (now they are 5). She is a very good hearted person, very genuine and compassionate. So compassionate that she started dating a guy who she felt sorry for because he was madly in love with her. And then he broke her heart. His confidence got so high that he was referring to himself as \"God\". And I'm not exaggerating! Crazy, I know...\n\n\nYears later we lost contact. Until today I keep in touch with my other girlfriends from school but Liz was different. She entered university and started working immediately. With all her talents and drive she got up the ladder pretty fast and didn\u2019t take long before she dropped out of uni. She disappeared. We rarely ever heard from her. But in my heart I always had love and aspiration for her. My other friends were pissed at her but I knew she is doing what she loves and wants, so who am I to judge\u2026\n\n\nAt uni I was under incredible pressure - I worked two jobs, while studying Law at the best university in my country and at an international school at the same time. And I had my heart broken. Then I met my now husband and had to deal with distance of 10 000km between us for 2 years. But I fought hard. Eventually, of course, I collapsed. It was really bad. That was about 8 years ago and is when my depression destroyed me. I couldn\u2019t deal with life. Oh man\u2026. Just thinking about all of this makes me want to cry AND vomit!\n\n\nAt the end of the day things got a bit better for me. I started therapy, pills and had huge support from my family (which by the way didn\u2019t come easily with my parents). Then we decided to marry and I asked her to be my maid of honor. We kept somewhat in touch during the years and this was a way for me to try to get close to her again.\n\n\nThe wedding was amazing, she helped me so much, everything was great, we were close again. Until I told her about my depression. I will never forget her eyes. She was looking at me with so much frustration, disappointment and even disgust. She started shouting at me, while I was crying after pouring my soul out. And I didn\u2019t even tell her 50% of the pain that was inside me all these years. Liz kept repeating: \u201cYou are not that weak, get yourself together, you cannot really be serious\". Then she got up and left my house. Without saying goodbye, without making an eye contact.\n\n\nThat was not even the most heartbreaking part. I knew it was a lot to take for her. I know it is not an easily acceptable topic. It is hard to realize all the pain I have been through. Even more so, considering she knew me as that tough girl who never stops and always aims at the top. I knew she needed time. So I gave it to her. She didn\u2019t reach out to me for more than 6 months. Not a single word. And all of a sudden she texted me saying she wants to talk and \u201cfight it out if we have to\u201d. Fight it out? Does she seriously believe we can \u201cfight out\u201d this conversation? She expects what - for me to say sorry I am depressed? Sorry I let you down? \n\n\nEven despite that I decided to give it a try so I texted her when I got back to my hometown. She got back to me saying she was working and has no time. Unbelievable. I still haven't seen her. That was two years ago. It is clear to me - it is all about priorities and I am not a priority for her at the end of the day.\n\n\nWell Liz\u2026 You are not a priority for me either. You are simply an example of one of the many people who don't want to hear about depression. You are one of those who think they are strong because they don't let themselves feel down. For you,  depressed are only the weak ones. But you are wrong, Liz. I am strong. Depressed doesn\u2019t mean weak. It means I have the courage to face my demons on a daily basis. To win my struggles and challenge my urge to perish every. single. day! Can you face your darkest thoughts? Can you face your monsters? Can you stop for a minute and ask yourself who you are and why you are? I can. I do.
