I am becoming obsessed with facts and a lot of these facts are about death. I am very smart and I have an fotographic memory so I don\u2019t really forget thinks. My mom thinks my feelings are fading away because of all these facts. I still do have feelings, but I never talk about them, I never show them and no one ever really notices if I\u2019m feeling down. Everyone knows me as the happy kid. I always smile. But it\u2019s never a genuine smile. My mom also thinks, because I read so much, I don\u2019t enjoy life anymore. This is very true. I think that that is the reason why I\u2019m obsessed with the death. I have suicidal thoughts and I want to die. I don\u2019t think I want to kill myselI, but I do want that something bad will happen to me. That I die of a natural cause. This might be a bit weird, but it\u2019s just the way it is. I\u2019m also an introvert. I can overthink everything. I can stare at a wall for hours and just think about life without getting bored. My mom thinks this is weird. She wants me to go to an psychologist. Do you guys think that is a good solution? Does a psychologist really help? And, has someone maybe experienced something like this?\n\nIf you take the time to reply to me, thank you dearly!\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I have made some mistakes in the grammar, I hope you\u2019ll understand it!",

Every day I try to stay on top of the hardship and sadness. I know I am utterly accountable for this failure of a life, I had a chance at a good life and a PhD but I threw it away and instead made extremely poor choices, and twenty years later I\u2019m trapped. About five years ago I worked at learning as much as I could about depression, betting it all on neuroplasticity and believing that if I just made enough positive changes and incorporated wellness practices, I could beat it. I took MBSR and developed a daily practice of meditation and yoga, I gratitude journal, I take supplements to reduce inflammation and improve gut health, I incorporated Morita therapy principles into my life in combination with Kanban planning to reduce procrastination and manage anxiety, I\u2019ve read The Body Keeps the Score and Pete Walker\u2019s books to help me with self-compassion (that\u2019s a struggle), I had a good psychologist but he is nearing retirement and it\u2019s not something I can afford to continue, I hike and camp and backpack to be immersed in nature and get some exercise, I drink water, I have a morning wellness routine, I just really thought I could finally turn this around if I just worked hard enough. But in the end, I\u2019m alone and hurting. I don\u2019t have family - my foster parents are predominantly absentee as they have many other priorities and I married someone with a drinking problem and refuses marriage counseling. Money is tight, I get by but it\u2019s not pretty. I\u2019m struggling with suicidal ideation, not because I want to die so much as it is just the only thing I can think of to stop hurting. I recognize the depression is getting more of a hold on me, but I don\u2019t realistically have much to hope for or dream of anymore within the context and reality of my life, and no more energy to fight. Part of me wonders if I am not actually alive, if maybe I am in some sort of purgatory and I ended my life years ago. If so, I want to sincerely, deeply, and authentically say I\u2019m sorry. I want to make amends. If this existence is a punishment for me, can I rectify my mistakes and have a chance at alleviating the depression and pain, or is this as good as it gets?",

                "Wow looks like you are doing everything right. I believe neuroplasticity is a thing when you are young and gets difficult to achieve the older you get. I think neurochemistry is at the heart of many cases. Typical antidepressants work in around 40% of cases but Im not sure they cure anything only they lift the fog enough so you don't commit suicide and have enough juice to change your behaviour patterns. They say entheogens can help cure depression but there's mixed data and a lot of hype but it looks promising. Other than there are five things which are 100% proven to lift depression. 1. Excercise, I have had luck with this, at a minimum you should aim for 1 hour a day for at least three times a week. 2. Reduce ruminating - the brain enjoys chewing the cud of the past, try cordon this off and look to now and the future only. 3. Counselling - you seem to be doing this, maybe look online for Skype therapy? It's cheaper... Maybe look to friends and colleagues and be more open with them,",
                "Thank you for this. You are right, I can increase exercise, I\u2019m getting in an hour 2-3 times per week but usually closer to 2 hours so that I can definitely improve. Since I hike after work and we\u2019ve been getting an unusual amount of rain, it\u2019s easy to make excuses but I can do better. I can also do better with working on present moment mindfulness and reducing rumination, it helps to just focus on the task at hand to reduce anxiety and I can do more of that. The challenge I have with being fully present is that I don\u2019t want this life and I don\u2019t have a future that looks any different; same hardships, triggers, and profound loneliness. I take similar supplements, Omega 3, D, turmeric, a probiotic - which B vitamin do you use? There seem to be several such as B complex and I\u2019ve thought about it but don\u2019t know much in this area. What has worked for me? Yoga and controlled breathing helps me with anxiety when it\u2019s bad, Kanban helps me with managing daily tasks and some minimal self-care, I\u2019m not doing good right now so I don\u2019t know what has helped with depression.

It\u2019ll be scary, but in the long run you\u2019ll be glad you did. \n\nBeyond that, you should look into therapy. If money is an issue, you can find therapists who offer a sliding scale who will offer discounted rates for people who need them. If the first person you try doesn\u2019t click, keep looking. Seriously consider looking into medication. If the idea of it worries you, talk with your therapist about it. Actually, you can make the fact that you are uneasy about meds part of the things you mention while you\u2019re looking for a therapist. If they do make you uneasy, you don\u2019t have to feel like someone\u2019s going to force you to take them. They CAN help, along with therapy (a lot of people forget they\u2019re not a \u201ccure,\u201d they\u2019re meant to help you feel a little more capable of looking at things in therapy, which can be hard), but it can take a while to find the right one for your particular brain chemistry. What works for some people is a mess of side effects for others. \n\nI know that all sounds like a lot. It can help to not look at the big picture for now, and maybe just break it up into smaller bits, like, today I\u2019ll make a list of therapists to try and contact (Psychology Today has a good searchable database of therapists on their site). Just make a list. If you feel up to more, go ahead, but if you don\u2019t, you still are closer than you were before. It might sound stupid, but I swear, it can help. \n\nLastly, depression lies. It tells you those things you\u2019re thinking, and they seem like they must be true because it says them in your voice. But it lies. When it gets that loud, I try to distract myself however I can, like watching some series I\u2019ve seen a million times, anything you can zone out to. It\u2019s like a feedback loop, and anything you can do to sort of switch your brain off and back on can help you get some space between you and that voice. \n\nThere\u2019s an other side to this feeling, and you can get back there."

I've tried self-help books, meditation, nutritional supplements, prescription drugs, and multiple rounds of therapy. My mental health has taken everything away from me. I dropped out of my dream college. I've lost almost all of my friends. I don't even leave the house from one week to the next sometimes. Everyday is agony. I'm always in physical pain that's probably either psychosomatic or because of my poor diet and fitness. I eat like crap because food is one of the few ways I can still enjoy myself. Insomnia and chronic acid reflux from my bad diet mean I'm always exhausted. None of my hobbies bring my joy anymore. Life is grey and meaningless.\n\nI have no reason to stay alive. It's not even that I want to die, or that I can't handle the pain anymore because I probably can, but being rational just tells me I'm not going to get better. If I'm like this forever, what's the point? Life without happiness is meaningless. Even if I did somehow get better though, it's too late now. I've lost out on so many experiences. I'll never get back my lost youth or the awesome college experience that I see everyone around me having. I took a distance-learning programme at a community college so as to have something, and to still get a degree, but it's not the same. I don't get to meet anyone or to socialise or to go partying or study abroad like everyone else does.\n\nIt's not like I have someone to be strong for either. There's no one I want to stay alive for. I've never dated anyone, never had many meaningful friendships, and I flatout don't care about my family anymore. A large part of this is their fault. I thought leaving college and returning to the family home would mean some support, but it hasn't. I don't know why I expected any different. My father was always, and continues to be, downright negligent. My earliest memory of him is his telling me that my birth was a mistake and that he wished he'd never had children. He's always dismissed my opinions as \"stupid\" or belittled my interests and choice in friends. Worst of all, he acts like a man in a perpetual midlife crisis; he spends money - including my own college funds in the past - recklessly. I grew up fearing homelessness.\n\nThen there's my brother. He's even worse. He's a drug addict whose illegal habits almost got us kicked out of our house. He got a teenage girl pregnant and leaves us to look after the child with no financial support whatsoever. All he does everyday is lie in bed stoned. At least my parents agreed to help, or they didn't kick him out anyway, but I didn't. I didn't ask to be looking after a four-year-old instead of studying the day before my final exam! I didn't ask to be unable to even call the few friends I have left because I can't even get that little time to myself anymore.\n\nMy mother is the last member of our household. She's the one decent person here. However, as I got into my teens, she has increasingly treated me like a personal therapist or a supportive friend and not her son. I hid my anxiety and depression from her for years because I didn't want to load her down with it. When I'm out or just not in the room with her, she texts me everytime she argues with my father or with how my brother is being problematic. I can't escape! Even at night, I'll be awoken by the noise from her arguing with my brother; her crying and him shouting (lying) that he's going to kill himself and it's all our fault because, for example, we refused to babysit his kid whilst he goes out drinking.\n\nI can't hold down a job because of my anxiety. My past experiences with seasonal jobs like Christmas or summer haven't been great. Medication makes me sweat profusely and one former boss said I look like a disgusting pig because of it. I sometimes stammer or tremble because of it too and my former coworkers used to all laugh at me behind my back. They'd infantise me as though I was some shut-in invalid. Without work though, I can never afford to leave my family. But even if I could, where would I go? I don't trust myself to live independently. One of the reasons I left college is because I wasn't eating, wasn't washing or attending class, or even getting out of bed. It was a path to death anyway!\n\nSo what do I do? There's literally no way out of my bad situation, no way to fix my broken mind that's constantly terrified, and no reason or nobody to stick around for. Ending it all right now will be a far less painful experience in the long run.",

Trouble is, you\u2019d have to get in a queue as I\u2019d use it on me first!\n\nI barely speak to anyone nowadays simply because every other human I see is just another potential for heartbreak and/or disappointment wrapped up flesh and skin. I\u2019ve watched too many Hollywood films which has made me expect that the \u201cspecial someone\u201d is just around the corner and they\u2019ll be in the least place you\u2019ll expect it! They\u2019re not. They never were. The best you can hope for is you meet someone who sort of hits most of your wants and needs and you can tolerate the bits you don\u2019t like. I really don\u2019t want to make you feel worse than you are, but honestly, I wish someone told me this a long time ago. Then I wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time hoping to meet that special someone. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s better if you keep your head down and do thing you want to do. In my case, I started going to the gym (I\u2019m 68 kg now, thank you for asking! \ud83d\ude02), increased my knowledge for work purposes and saved some money to leave me in a better position. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s completely replaced human relationships for me, but it\u2019s certainly ameliorated the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, I really wish you the best and hope you find some happiness in your life, I really do. All I am saying is don\u2019t be surprised if it doesn\u2019t happen for you.....",

I feel like that would complicate things and you'd lose focus on what may lie ahead on your path. \n\nExplore any and everything that might be of interest to you. It's easier said than done, but the more you insert yourself to the world, the right people will come to you.

I was drowning, I was; but somehow by getting professional help and going to therapeutic group lessons I figured out I wasn\u2019t alone in  feeling hopeless about life itself. I would recommend going to a psychologist and getting all the help you can. \n\nI hope you feel better soon. \n\nRemember, loneliness is the opposite from connection.",

So many of the things you mentioned, I know exactly how you feel because I have the exact same problem. Like not wanting to burden anyone with my problems so I smile and say I'm fine. I know, really, I do. \n\nSo if you ever need anything, help, advice or just someone to talk to then feel free to DM me and I promise I'll do my best to respond as soon as possible. I am not able to professional help like an actual psychologist, but I can do my best to offer my friendship and kindness. So like I said, if you need or want anything, feel free to DM me.",

That all being said I just want to tell you that things will get better, even our darkest hours pass eventually.\n\nI also relate to the cookie cutter bullshit a lot of people who say they're willing to help you do, it's so hard to find genuine people and that contributes massively to the loneliness and I get that. But there's also so many good hearted genuine people out there, they exist, even if they're rarer than gold.\n\nIf you ever need to talk you can message me, though I can't guarantee I'll respond quickly since I'm busy often.\n\nDon't give up is my plead to you, I was in just as dark a place as you just a couple months ago and it passed, things can get better I promise.

I\u2019m going through the same thing but I was lucky enough to have a small amount of friends who are there and listen to my rant all the time but even for them I didn\u2019t go deep into my emotions. For the emotions that I can\u2019t tell my friends I\u2019ve been writing them down in my journal just so I have some of those heavy feeling lifted at least for a bit. And I know it\u2019s not a healthy thing but another thing is j desperately try to distract my mind from going into my depressed episodes by watching something all the time or listening to \u201cupbeat\u201d music not the sad ones and dance along to it. It sorta help me for the times I\u2019m awake. And before I go to bed I make my eyes as tired as possible (it\u2019s not healthy either but) and I would just fall asleep while looking at my phone. This is what I\u2019ve been doing so far to help me look like I\u2019m ok. So this may not be a good advice for long term but I hope it helps you for the short term.",

I know when I'm in that place, there's not much anyone can really say to get me out of it, but just being around loving people helps me (even though my depressed brain says it won't).  Fully second the advice to explore therapy and a psychiatrist-- both have been game-changers for me.  Until then, be kind to yourself"

            "patterns": "I feel this way far too often.... I\u2019m 22yo and I want to die almost every day. As time goes on, the thoughts of suicide increased and seem more and more appealing. It started to get scary for me once I realized that the one thing stopping me from actually offing myself (the pain I would cause others around me) didn\u2019t matter to me anymore and that dying would be worth it. Because id be dead and nothing would matter. The only thing stopping me now is the fear of becoming paralyzed or failing the attempt and having to live with that. So I just hope every day I get hit by a car on my way to work or die by some kind of freak accident. I feel so alone all the time even though I have supportive friends/family. While I\u2019m not alone physically, mentally I can\u2019t help but feel worthless and like people hate me. I know the cliche of people telling depressed people that they\u2019re \u201cnot a burden\u201d I just feel like that\u2019s untrue. I feel like this issue is consistent enough that having to have someone help me and comfort me when I become this way prevents them from living their best life and it takes away from their happiness. I know that being around me is not easy when I am depressed or having an anxiety attack. I have a really hard time verbalizing my thoughts and feelings because I feel like if I don\u2019t say them out loud then they won\u2019t be as real. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working very hard on these last few years but it\u2019s still a work in progress. I know that might sound crazy but it\u2019s just how I rationalize my lack of coping mechanisms I guess. I feel like I can pinpoint all of my issues and I\u2019m pretty self aware. I want to change desperately but for some reason I can never pull myself out of the void once I feel myself sink in. And it\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s hard for the close ones around me trying to help. I can\u2019t let them in no matter how much I want to. I just feel like there\u2019s only so much someone can do before giving up on you. It tears me up inside. I\u2019m worried about my relationship failing because of my inability to fight the depression. We\u2019ve been together nearly 6 years and he is the most amazing and supportive person I\u2019ve ever met. But a person can only take so much for so long. In my opinion anyways. I lay in bed most of the day usually sleeping or watching videos when I\u2019m not working my full-time job + a part-time job to just barely be able to pay my bills. The financial stress of being 22 years old, fully self sufficient, living in a big city is insane. I have a history of disordered eating that I\u2019ve noticed resurface this past year. I eat, on average, maybe 6-8 small meals a week. I know eating helps stabilize mood but my ED makes me actually physically nauseous even just thinking about food. Attempting to eat triggers my gag reflex and I\u2019ve puked on several occasions just trying to satiate myself. I just try to tell myself that these thoughts are temporary and that better times will come and make living worth it. I don\u2019t know if I even believe that but trying to have some optimism helps a little. Ive used marijuana as a crutch to help deal with my ED/depression for years, smoking several times daily. I actually just decided last week that it\u2019s time for a break (hopefully to quit permanently). I feel like it used to help but it has just started to hurt me and I haven\u2019t even enjoyed smoking for a long time I just do it out of habit. I feel like it\u2019s making me stupid. On top of my depression that I also feel makes me stupid. Obviously I know healthy diet, exercise/meditation/breath work help symptoms. But committing and forcing myself to do these things regularly seems nearly impossible for me. I can\u2019t find joy or interest in ANYTHING. Which makes it really hard to distract my mind from my thoughts. Antidepressants/anxiety medications (viibryd) have also helped me in the past but I\u2019m not financially stable enough currently to go see a doctors. And I\u2019m not feeling this way every day, it comes and it goes. But it comes and goes fairly frequently. frequently enough that it gets insanely exhausting having to constantly regulate my thoughts and tell myself to snap out of it. If I repress, things get worse. If I let it out, I spiral out of control. I\u2019m not looking for people to tell me that things get better, I\u2019m hoping someone can offer useful guidance, tips or advice to maybe help me pull myself out of the void when I fall in. I hope someone can relate and find comfort knowing they\u2019re not alone. Deep down I know I\u2019m not alone but all logic gets thrown out the window once the cloud comes over my head.",

I lost had my basketball scholarship after tearing my ACL and getting in a car wreck, shattering my hand, both within a few months of each other. I couldn't play the same game again. Two years after, I  lost my girlfriend of four years to suicide after she was raped causing a miscarriage of our 4 month-year-old. I can't say I never thought about suicide but I guess I loved myself too much to follow through with it. I'd cut my shoulder until blood dripped from my fingertips because it was easier to hide the mental pain with physical. I can't say there's a magical pill that will make the pain all go away but I do know pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, a day, or even a year but eventually, it will subside. I got up every day went to school, put on a smile and made it one day at a time. It wasn't easy but if I hadn't I wouldn't be where I am today and if I had to go through all the therapy sessions, if I hadn't stripped myself of my medication and healed naturally with the help of my psychologist. I would still be relying on those pills. Gotta take the bull by the horns and get up and show up no matter what even if it's just a baby step as small as making your bed in the morning. At least you can say you did something that day."

You have to focus on yourself. Not to be mean, but that mentality will cause yourself to jump into a relationship you are not respected in. I\u2019ve fallen for this and wasted many years cuz of it. You have to find happiness from yourself. \n\nNot only that, but girls are more attracted to confident, happy guys.

Now the school year is ending, and I have so many things to finish and make up because I was gone for two weeks. The stress of school with everything going on in life is too much. I just want to swallow my entire bottle of pills, or find a nice tall building to jump off of, or just die while I sleep. I don\u2019t want to live anymore.

I spent most of my life as a high functioning person and was always in the top 10% of the population income wise.  I've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since I was a kid but I was always able to \"handle\" it and stay high functioning.  Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  That was it, I had no strength left to put up my front and I dropped quickly into a deep depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell 5 years later I'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when I try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  I feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  I even feel like a horrible father because some days I can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and I give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I \"must always have been a secret narcissist\".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.  Some just didn't know how to deal with me when I was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have nothing left.  There is nothing inside of me.  I want to die all the time. I've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, TMS treatments, ECT treatments, day therapy programs, DBT/CBT training, anything they wanted me to try I did.  Nothing.  I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said \"its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again\" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  I can't live feeling like I have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  No money, no job, no friends, what's left?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that's held me back for the past year is my daughter.  She's 10.  She is all that matters to me.  I don't want to desert her, but I often patterns if I add anything to her life anyway.  And its hard to live for \"every other week\" with someone especially when those weeks can be so hard mentally.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this except to vent.

                "The depression detaches us from realities. The \"you\" that was your successful self is still there. You have the same brain that achieved all that. \n\nWhat has changed is that your head has slipped into a habit of over-processing and ovsessiving about the negative. We depressive have problems because of the way our heads process stimulus, not because of some crazy dumbing-down \"brain rot\". \n\nThe old part of our brain has a place called the limbic system. The LS is heavily involved in our emotional response. I have never figured out why the LS has such a command of language, but it come up with Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTs) that we perecieve in the form of our brains being completely hijacked by hearing rentless things such as \"I'm a loser\" \"I am worthless\" \" I'd do the world a favor by just being dead\" yadda, yadda, yadda... That's the work of the LS. \n\nWhat happens in this horrible, soul-killing barrage is that our prefrontal cortex (the logic center, just behind the eyebrows) tries desparately to counter the ANTs. The PFC detects the ANTs and we percieve the ANTs like a voice of authority in our heads. The ANTs are are real as the math your 3rd grade teacher taught- to our psyche. The problem is, that the ANTs are complete fabrication and the PFC goes on a wild goosechase trying to are against them. But the PFC is pussing in the wind. If the ANT says \"I'm a loser\", the PFC gets caught up in a losing argument. There is no defination of \" a loser\". \"Loser\" is a taunt, not a real state of being. You can't make a single, iviversal defination of \"loser\" in the way you could define \"CEO\" or \"dean\". Defining \"loser\" is like defining the exact shape of a water drop. You can't. And neither can your PFC. But it tries. And tries. And tries. \n\nAnd befor you know it, the PFC that you used to run your past life is mainly preoccupied with dealing with the drivel the ANTs throw out. Ya, no, you can't get your old life back without your PFC focusing on the realities of real life- your job and it's complexities, your social life, being a dad. \n\nSO, what do you do about all this confrontaion between the ANTs and the PFC? \n\nStop the ANTs. It's like getting 2 old, bickering married people to quit with that old  roleplay and really get some life lived. \n\nI went through about 7 therapists and 3 Rx's and still had the same depression of 37 years. \n\nI won't tell you what to do, but I will tell you what I did. \n\nI identified that I needed to control the ANTs. They were crippling me, hobbling me, holding me back from living and being productive. (Via many ways).\n\nI felt like I had ZERO control over anything, really- not my in my ability to earn money, my finances, my kids, my household, traffic, nit even in contol of what was goi g on in my own head. \n\nSo, I deduced that creating some control in my life would, at the very least, serve to counter the feeling that nothing else was in my control. \n\nAnd I had little time to myself (overbearing, controling now ex spouse) and no money, of course. \n\nSo I created a little world for myself I called \"the power trip\". I had an old pair of running shoes. I'd go out for a jog alone. And I created an experience of COMPLETE CONTROL. \n\nI'd get out of earshot of the ex and start. I'd say OUT LOUD somthin like \"I am in control of running 3 sreps on the right side of the sidewalk\", and do it immediately.  \"I am in control of taking 2 deep breaths in a row\". \"I am in control of pushing my left sleeve half way up my arm\". \"I am in control of... \" you get the idea. I said it out loud because I that THAT much trouble otherwise escaping the ANTs. But during the full mind and body immersion od a power trip, my head did not have the capacity to speak, act and be creative for the next little control task to acknowledge any ANTs. I made time for my power trip about 5 of 7 days per week. About 20 minutes at a time. If I couldn't jog, I walked. \n\nIt worked. But in ways I never had anticipated. Sure I got a little break form my ANTs+my personal grade A anxiety. \n\nWhat also happens is that my PFC stopped playing it's stupid games with the ANTs. It's like my PFC stopped tolerating them. My PFC called their BS. \n\nAnd then the ANTs stopped. \n\nMy PFC is now free from dealig with the stupid Automatic Negative Thoughts endlessly spring from my Limbic System. I have the freedom to use my PFC as I chose again. Oddly enough, with the computing power of my prefrontal cortex in my control, my life is a millon times better than what it ever was as a depressive. \n\nMaybe my story will help you.

Most of the time after a dark episode, I always realize my own mind is what\u2019s making everything so awful. I\u2019m not being mindful and I\u2019ve paused from living in the moment. People such as friends and fam often come across as not caring when really they do, they might just have their own crap going on that they are learning to emotionally handle, and they aren\u2019t being there because they don\u2019t even realize their own selfish behaviors and by default people are just naturally super selfish, not that that that justifies it or anything. But depression is like a huge toxic stain in your mind that blocks your clear view of things. We ourselves can be our own worst enemies. I honestly recommend, maybe when you find a job\nthat you like that offers insurance and benefits, you can find a therapist or even now there are things I\u2019ve heard of that work well like TalkSpace which is therapy on your phone where you kinda like FaceTime or something with a professional, or so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told what it\u2019s like.

I\u2019ve been where you are, and I promise it really helps but you have to do it on a consistent healthy basis. It\u2019s just baby steps and being patient with yourself, and also being gentle with yourself and rewarding yourself for even making it out of bed when you feel this way.

                "Keep at it. Your depression, like mine, was years and years in the making and reinforcing. \n\nThe strategy I took is unique. After about decade of outside help, I asked myself, \"Doing what I am doing, am I getting the results I want to get?\" \n\n(At this point in my life I was barely making money, catering to every whim of an ogre narcissist, and on the verge of failing to pay my bills and rent, and would lose custody of my kids with no residence. My kids were no the ogre's kids. The ogre almost dumped me of at an ER to be commited for a sucidal breakdown once already, but chickened out because he wouldn't get access to my child support money any more.)\n\nThe medicine made me feel jitter and jumpy and caused a racing heart at \"regular doses\", so i was reduced to a bare minimun dose, so I don't think the drug manage my depression much. \n\nTherapy was a place I went to and he or she let me talk. I felt like 95% of the therapy was what I would say to the mirror after reading a self-help article of Better Homes and Gardens. \n\nI have a BA in psychology. I decided to add real beain science to my anti-depression crusade. \n\nI experienced my depression setting up camp in my brain as a 7 year old child, with a fairly simple life of school, a pet hermit crab, and little else. No friends a single toddler sibling , and hand-off, detachment parents. \n\nI remember distinctly the Automatic Negative Thoughts coming from the back/rear of my head. The part of my head the tried in vein to counter the ANTs was the front part, the Prefrontal Cortex, as I much later learned. \n\nThe back and front were at war. Every night, I'd sob in seething pain of hating to be alive and in shame and seering guilt of feeling the way I felt. I hid it from my parents, although it was not hard. \n\nMy mental picture of it all was like that of the \"Last Judgement\" with the horrors of hell at the bottom and the goodness of Jesus and heven up top, like the back/bottom of my head and front/top of my head. \n\nFast forward to my mid 40's and being on the bring of committed to an institution. \n\nI knew from my experience as a child, that the depression had a source in the brain. I looked at brain anatomy and best I can I dentify, it is from the area of the Limbic System and Dorsal Raphe Nucleus. (LS and DRN) \n\nIt was like the LS has a megaphone in my head and the PFC wispered. Or, as if in the war in my head, the LS had rocket laungers and M80's  and the PFC had bb guns. TOTAL IMBALANCE.\n\nSo, as I explained, I sought out to balance the volume of the LS and PFC. \n\nFrom my classes in college, I k ew about neurons, a bit about how they fire in sequence and wire together and how \"muscle memory\" can trigger reflexive firing, luke when we tire our shoes. With repetition, executing the action of tying our shoes does not require the step-by-step thought process.\n\nTurns out, it takes a certain number of hours of specific practice to get a certain chain of neuron to wire together. I. 10 hours, you have a pretty good wiring, and with thousands of hours you are considered a \"professional\" or a \" master\" at something. Well, guess how many hours in our lifetime we have spent \"mastering\" our depression? Especially in relation to hours spent on a specific depression counter-measure. It's numbers. 5, 6, 7 hours is nothing to judge success by when I know my brain has been actively supporting its own depressive habits for THOUSANDS of hours since I was 7 years old. \n\nSo, I took the approach of training like an athlete trains for an upcoming sports season. \n\nSuppose would- be soccer player \"Chris\" gets some shin guards and soccer shoes, reads up a bit on soccer rules, and practices moves 45 minutes per week in the 6 weeks preceding the first game.\n\nSuppose would-be soccer player \"Pat\" gets some shin guards, shoes and learns the rules also, but practices every single day. Time spent learning to dribble the ball up and down the field, defend around oponent, headiing an incoming ball, etc. If \"Pat's\" total minutes of specific practice on repeating a single move of maneuvering the ball around a cone in practice is a total of 15 minutes a day, times 4 days a week time 6 weeks of pre-season, Pat has accumulated 6 hous of specific practice on that maneuver.\n\nWho is going to be more ready to perform as a soccer player at the first game?? \n\n(The analogy is that I am the would-be soccer player and the 1st game is an looming depressive episode.)\n\nWhat I had to to was bring elements of purely OBJECTIVE reality into my anti-depressive crusade. \"X\" number of minutes doing my \"in control\" exercise was one of those objective elements.\n\nNothing from my verious therapists was ever that kind of specific. It was always \"well, how do you feel after.... \" \"how do you feel since...\" \"how are you feeling....\"  Newsflash: reporting a \"feeling\" is completey subjective. \n\nI needed balance in subjective and objective. Not all or nothing, just some of each. \n\nIt turns out, that is the key to overcomi g depression, too. Balance between the volume and authority of the various areas of our brains.",

I am involved and help establish programs for youth, feeding the poor, medicine for the sick, educating children, etc. I believe it's important to address physical needs. Jesus did this. He healed the sick and fed the hungry. He was also a teacher. But at the same time im doing these things, I'm praying for people.

I'm also sure that there is something happening in his family (with his brothers and such). I know what he does to me (for better or worse) is just an outlet for his emotions but growing up, there was a lot of physical abuse. It's not as frequent now (as in there hasn't been a serious incident in about a year) but when I was younger, there were times I'm pretty sure he wanted to kill me out of anger (chocking me and stabbing me with a kitchen knife). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom grew up in a very sheltered environment and got married with very idealistic expectations. However, my wonderful dad being the amazing person he is, decided to abuse her. I was born a bit less than a year after they got married and I know that my mom sees me as competition for my dad's attention (which honestly, I'm fine without). She was slightly physically abusive when I was younger but now it's just her acting out for all that's happened to her. I don't know what to think about her, she usually took my dad's side when I was younger (probably in an attempt to diffuse his anger) but she also stood in his way.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for my brother. When I was younger (around 6th grade, my brother was 6), my parents used to leave him with me for a couple of hours (while they got home from work). I tried my best to take care of him but I did at times resort to yelling and being slightly physical (slightly dragging/ shaking the chair he was sitting in around) at him, especially when he wouldn't eat (I didn't want my parents to think I didn't take good care of him). I have learned from all that and have much better techniques for dealing with children and my brother respects what I say and will listen (mostly). Anyway, my parents are a lot different with him than they are with me. They're a lot milder in their actions and do spend a lot of time with him (in a pleasant way and no, nothing sexual either). I still do think they are lacking as parents though and have tried to make up for them in certain avenues (mostly in terms of helping him with relationships with others). My only problem is that there are certain times I start attacking him verbally. I hate that my parents place his opinion higher than my own especially because it's about my life and I hate that he plays along. I know its not his fault and that he's just unconsciously doing what my parents do but I cannot seem to control myself. I hate it when my dad joins in and usually ends up telling me to kill myself/ they'd be better off with me dead. At this point, my mom usually comes in and makes a joke out of it. I know it's her way of diffusing the situation but I still hate when she does that. This usually leads to me attacking her verbally (and I just have to know everything that could possibly make her upset) and she ends up yelling at me and telling me she hates me and stuff. And this is usually with my dad either laughing or saying I'll end up dead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure what to do anymore. I feel like I'm going insane. There are certain times my parents are nice. They buy me things and we can have civil conversations and even laugh together (which usually end with me doing something wrong and them yelling at me). I really don't know how to feel about them either. 95% of times I would say they hate me but the other 5%, I can say they at least tolerate me. And then there's the entire thing with teenagers hating their parents, I'm 17 so I'm not even sure if my feelings are just because of my age (there is a part of me that says it has nothing to do with my age but I'm not sure if its right, or that I even want to listen to it). I'm not even sure if everything that's happened to me is truly abnormal either. I mean, I do look online, I have done my research on child abuse but at the end of the day, it's all theoretical. There's a part of me that knows this is wrong but there's a larger part who has no clue (and my parents' gaslighting doesn't help) and I'm left trying to figure out what in the world is wrong with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel like I cannot do this anymore, I'm drowning and there isn't much I can use to hold on. Every time my parents yell at me, I feel like dying. I really want to leave everything behind. And it wouldn't be that hard either. I'm pretty sure my parents would be fine with it (they've told me that a plethora of times already) and even if they aren't, I cannot say I care. In terms of my friends, I'm going to college soon and I can assure you none of us are close enough to even try keeping in contact (so I doubt they'll even know). And my brother, I'm not sure about him, he's the only one I really worry about but I'm sure I can get around that (probably just make him hate me or something). And it's not that I want to die, I can even assure you that I won't do anything drastic to myself (it doesn't make sense, I'm going off to college in a couple off months and I barely need to deal with them again) it just feels easier at times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just not sure what to do. I don't even think I ever seriously considered myself at this point (like I'm pretty sure I would be dead by now). I'm not even sure how psychologically messed up I am and I'm sure I have depression and PTSD. The worst part is, I'm not even sure if I'm just taking things too seriously and overreacting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, I'm sorry this was so long. I would usually edit this but I don't think I'd be able to post it if I re-read it so sorry for any errors in grammar/ spelling/ etc. Also, this is my first post on reddit and I want to apologize if I did/ said anything wrong.

Given that, it's up to you to decide if you're overreacting.\n\nMy advice would be: Minimize friction. Keep things typical if need be. Leave any thoughts of hate etc, obviously your parents have done lots of things wrong but don't let thoughts of hatred either towards you from your parents, or the other way around, have any negative impact on you and hold you back. Just hang on till you leave for college. Also don't erase your old friends as a self-fulfilling prophecy but at the same time try to meet as many people as possible in college, it will only do you good. Try to lead a healthy life, physically and emotionally (minimize contact with toxic people) and academically.\n\nRegarding depression and ptsd: since your life is going to be better in a little while I'd say avoid to put any labels, there's no use to it for the time being. Leave it at that for now and you can re-evaluate later. \n\nHow does that sound? If you have any patternss let me know.",

I was so alone then, no one to confide in, so worthless, so hopeless, so strongly believing it can't get better, and might as well end it now.  I have so many days where I have to fight with myself not to cut, try to convince myself it's not worth it.  Tonight it's so low again, and I want to cut to die... but he still tells me I'm not depressive... How do I tell him?.. How do I tell him without him not believing me bcuz I hid it so well?... How do I sit alone tonight with no one to talk to and not decide to die?...",

He got out blocked me for 8 months then talked to me again and around that time i was doing heroin and meth all the time i overdosed lost 4 good friends and the other friends i had all grew up got married or had kids my best friend has 2 kids and is married as well.\n\nWell 2yrs ago I started suboxone was still using on n off then the start of this yr i really started to sober up and only take my meds. He helped me get into the best psychiatric doc in our area and I've seen her for about 4 months now and tried a couple meds.\n\nMy best friend has always been the one who tries to keep me going and sometimes I get angry because he always mentioned religion along with his words of wisdom. Over the last 4 months or so I've really hit rock bottom.\n\nI told him about how every bday since ive gotten out of jail ive stayed at home and cried alone and he offered to do something with me that day. Then went on vacation the whole week of my bday and I watched his dog. \n\nMy attitude towards him keeps going downhill because ever since I met him he always says well do this or that. Everytime I ask him to do something hes busy with his kids and wife. He doesnt work stays at home with the kids all day and she makes candy for a living. I know she doesnt like me and that probably factors in to his decisions.\n\nIdk the last 4 weeks I've been really depressed and told him about me figuring out how and were I'd hangmy self. He always says something that'll keep me going and say that we will do things and I snapped I said cuz I want to die now cuz i have no will to live or go on now you wanna do things what's different now then the past 3 yrs you were less busy when I first met you and only had one kid now your always busy and claim again well do things friends do? \n\nWell yesterday was his day and he was home with only his son and I offered to rent some movies and hang out celebrate his birthday because his wife is with there daughter at the hospital cuz she has a lung infection well he basically changed the subject and didnt reply for hrs so I freaked out on him and said you always say were going to do this or that but in the last 3 yrs we havent done anything except use drugs for a month together and you broke my car left the next day to treatment blocked mentor how long and offer to do something on my birthday and then go on vacation and I offer to see you on your birthday and you blankly decline.\n\n\nIdk lately I just want to say things to him that will hurt him because hes hurt me for so long and the things he did when to me when we used.

Hes mentioned coffee before and I agree and then something always happens. \n\nFuck i just want to make him cry and point out everything shitty hes ever done his life.

Happiness comes and goes relative to what we are experiencing in the moment. What people are really striving for is actually contentment, whether they realise it or not.\n\nSpeak with someone you trust, or  perhaps a doctor directly, if you feel uncertain about telling a parent. Things can get better. Being young can be really tough, but a lot of the time, adulthood brings confidence and determination, hobbies, relationships, goals, etc that can bring a level of contentment and makes life worthwhile.

When it\u2019s used to address my feelings by my therapist, I find myself cringing \u2014 because I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s depression, but at the same time it does. I\u2019m not in any way suicidal, even if I get those \u201cI want to die\u201d feelings. I\u2019m a fourteen year old girl, no surprise there, but I also hate just blaming it on \u201chormones\u201d and shrugging it away.\n\nI\u2019m told to find people I can talk to, but I don\u2019t really have anyone. I can\u2019t dump it on my friends, my parents aren\u2019t much help, and everything that\u2019s suggested I block with logic. Even to my therapist I will say, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it can be helped.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a constant feeling of nothing sometimes, like I want to be sad but I\u2019m not. I still find joy in things, but the feeling doesn\u2019t go away fully. Sometimes it gets worse \u2014 sometimes I get internal emotional breakdowns. One day I was so desperate to go home that I fully wanted to walk in front of a car, and probably would\u2019ve if I wasn\u2019t stuck in school.\n\nMy social life is fine, I have friends and I\u2019m not near unpopular. (I\u2019m neutral.) I am new this year, and I skipped a grade, but I\u2019m so used to being new that it doesn\u2019t ruffle me anymore. I love talking to people, I\u2019m a total extrovert, and I get lonely easily. And yet, it persists.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a feeling like I\u2019m made of lead, like I have a desperation for something, but what?  I can\u2019t say. I want to die, but I don\u2019t actually want to by any means. I\u2019ll be miserable, and what makes it so much worse is putting on a brave face. Homework and small tasks feel like a mighty challenge, and I often feel like I can\u2019t take things.\n\nI will get not-yet overwhelming desire to cut myself, and once I even played with it, but our kitchen knives were too dull to break skin. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m crying over how dramatic things are, I don\u2019t have a tough life, I\u2019m *happy* \u2014 and yet, I\u2019m not.\n\nIf my mind isn\u2019t engaged for even a few seconds, the feeling will worsen. I need to be really thinking and talking to dull it, even if it still lingers. I have misophonia, intolerance of sound, and certain sounds like my mom\u2019s repetitive mucusy asthma cough enrages me and makes me (in that moment) fully want to die. I also have auditory hallucinations, although all this comes with perfect pitch. Could this be hearing related? I don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s just a constant confusing feeling that I don\u2019t know what to do with. I\u2019ve worked through a lot of anxiety and self-hate with my therapist \u2014 I used to be borderline suicidal in sixth grade \u2014 so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m hating myself and wanting to die. It\u2019s like now that that hole of expression has been filled, the feeling just sits there. I can\u2019t really talk to anyone, my parents are useless and I can\u2019t dump these feelings on my friends. (Besides, all I ever get are people trying to solve my problems or saying \u201chaha same\u201d.) My therapist has pointed out that, even though I feel like I can\u2019t take things, I do them. And yes, I do, but I\u2019m not sure I can keep doing this for three years. I\u2019ll reiterate, there\u2019s nothing wrong in my school life. I get terrible paranoia about other people, but deep down I know I\u2019m fine.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about my rambling. Does anyone else get this? I feel suicidal but don\u2019t want to die. (Apparently that\u2019s a thing, I read an article when I doubted my feelings were real.) I really can\u2019t describe that constant feeling, but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t emotionally handle anything. No one is really any help. Is this depression, or am I just... I don\u2019t know.",

The same family that told me when I was 16 with suicidal thoughts, that I shouldn\u2019t complain because other people had it worse than me. I\u2019m constantly being picked on for the way I look and how I act and they\u2019re constantly yelling at each other each day which fucks with my anxiety. I can\u2019t even make eye contact with them before they think I\u2019m giving them the dirty look and will start an argument. Just last week, my mom bluntly said that my cousins are doing so well in school and asked what happened to me to become a dropout and stay in my room all day. And I told my mom so many fucking times I want to die and this family is horrible but she won\u2019t listen to me or she thinks it\u2019s just a silly phase. \n\nI haven\u2019t showered in months because my family convinced me I was too fat (which was true, I gained like 30 kgs from all the stress eating) but it had such a negative impact on me, I couldn\u2019t stand to see my myself naked and I\u2019ve lost about 10 kgs from starving myself. I pull out my own hair and chew on my fingers and take joy from the pain, I keep having nightmares each night that fucks me up like that one nightmare where my family roasted my cat in the oven and it felt so fucking real that I stayed up for days after that. \n\nMy whole family knows I want to kill myself. But they don\u2019t care or they keep triggering it and they laugh at my face for being weak. \n\nI\u2019m struggling to get a job because my anxiety fucks me up in the interviews, I got no money, I can't move out, I can\u2019t escape from my family. I\u2019m trapped.  ",

I\u2019ve been suffering with Depression since about 9 myself, my point is puberty does tend to kick start depression.\n\nThe decision with all depression episodes is always the same: is there anything worth living for? Ask friends and family, even if the reason your living today is to not hurt them. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to live, the next step is to decide not to live like this. That means talking to your drs honestly and openly. I\u2019d recommend talking about the thing you don\u2019t want to talk about the most. \n\nI also recommend journalling. What are your problems and what are possible solutions then get rid of the quick and easy ones ASAP. Don\u2019t be afraid to destroy relationships and bonds etc. You need a fresh foundation to build from the ground up.\n\nAlso I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve been on Prozac for a while, go back and tell them it\u2019s not working. If it\u2019s not been that long then wait it out.  ",
                "Hey. 30 years ago I was you. It's wasn't easy. And it doesn't go away. You will always have your disorders, sometimes you will be in control, and sometimes not, but these feelings are you, they aren't going anywhere.\n\nSo we cope. Meds don't solve anything, but they help clear the fog in our heads a bit. We have to learn to cope and exist with all the happy platitudes and expectations of people who don't actually give a shit. You have to give a shit for yourself. You are the only person who you need to prove anything to.\n\nSo, cope. \n\nFind support you trust. People that will not judge or patterns you. This might be a friend, an adult, or a professional. Maybe a redditor. Identify to yourself, what does a healthy, supportive relationship feel like? Got that feeling? Good. Do NOT accept any relationship that doesn't feel that way. You don't have the energy for anyone that doesn't bring you up.\n\nIf your meds don't help don't take them. Doctors are stupid weak humans just like you and I and they have no clue what works and doesn't because every human body is different. They just throw pills at us and hope we get a good mix going. DO tell your doctor the truth about how your meds are going. Hate your meds? Tell him. Not taking them? Tell him. Want something more or different? Tell him. \n\nThis is temporary. We don't live in the past, and we can't see the future. We have now and that's it. Stay in now. Don't leave to visit the mistakes in the past, and don't invent terrible futures to have anxiety about.  These are the lies our mind tells us to trap us in our pain.\n\nWrite. Doesn't matter if your grammer sucks. Write about your feelings, dreams, fears, about you. The act of writing these out allows you to better understand what you are thinking.\n\nHere is a simple exercise that I have recently learned, it is from a book called battle of the mind. The three C's.\n\nCatch: recognize your trigger responses and bad thoughts. \n\nCheck: patterns and challenge these thoughts. Are they fact or feeling? What is the evidence for it? What is the evidence against it? Are you leaving something out or exaggerating another?\n\nChange: what can you do or think instead of this? Try it.\n\nAnother good exercise is to write down your trigger responses you can remember. Then write down what would calm you, make you feel safe during those responses. This gives you more awareness of what to avoid in life.\n\nPlease don't die. The whole world might hate you but I want you to stay. I'm no one special but one person is enough to stay one more day right? See you later space cowboy.\n\n",

Trust me when I say that I understand how you feel right down to the letter. You need help.  At the least, you need someone to talk to...\nFor that, you *HAVE* to make an effort yourself. Go up to someone you really trust and tell them everything that's on your mind. If you don't make that effort, you won't be able to fight it. Just talk about it. It makes you feel better. Maybe to your parents , relatives , friends or anyone else you trust.

Just this morning I was looking through the medications we have at home to see what sort of thing could kill me with an overdose. The flair is \"requesting support\", but I only put that because it needs a flair. Just ignore this, it doesn't matter. ",

Not exactly the \"alone\" part, ill get to that in a minute, but the \"nothing feels like home.\" I don't feel at home anywhere. For months, ive just been feeling so empty, and here recently, my family just makes it worse. The last time I felt at home anywhere was at my ex GF's house a couple weeks ago.\n\nOn the topic of my parents;They aren't bad. They aren't abusive. They are good, Christian people. Not the \"Trans people are going to hell\" christian, the \"help the homeless guy\" Christian. The \"treat others as you yourself want to be treated\" Christian (And trust me, they take that seriously). They do their best. They try, they really do, and I can recognize that. But, something broke inside of me. I can't accomplish anything around my dad, because i'm afraid he'll say \"Good job, son.\"\n\nI don't know whats wrong with me, but any words from them that would normally be encouraging to other kids, those words seem to hurt me. I don't mean just mentally, but i can feel it. It gets harder to breath, there's this new weight in my stomach on top of the already present anxiety and stress.\n\nEvery time I talk to my parents, I die a little. Every time I talk to my parents, I want to die a little more.\n\nI can't feel joy anymore either. It started when I realized that things that used to be enjoyable and fun just weren't anymore. I tried to find new things, but nothing is anymore.\n\nThe only thing that calms me down is nicotine. its the only thing that keeps me from knocking someone out. But I can't keep going with that, i'm a minor, and i don't make enough money to pay that damned fine when I get caught.\n\nI remember my love for Planes. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, you name it. Does it have a motor? Does it move with that motor? I loved it. I also remember my love for Military. I got one of those Facebook Memory things from my mom a few days ago, and it was pretty much my mom asking how many times I can say \"Tactical Nuke\" coherently in a sentence while playing barbie with my sister. I remember the dreams of joining the fight, of coming home a hero. Now I dream about how little of my body they can recover if i go.\n\nAnd I say dream, because it plays into the title of this post. \"Passively Suicidal.\"\n\nI don't find joy in anything I used to. Tearing down a motor with my friend? Not anymore, apparently. Playing any of this ridiculous amount of video games I have? Nada. My life has come down to lying in bed, thinking about the bliss of death, or lying in bed, thinking about when I was able to hold the only person I care about anymore in my arms and just be happy.\n\nI'm in between houses. Currently renting from a family friend. We left a house that was too expensive to live in (Probably because of how long my showers are, jesus christ thats a big water bill) guided by my parents dream of building a little house thats just big enough for our family out in the woods. I'm in between houses, not sure if we have the money to find a new place to live before the house we are renting gets sold. Because apparently we are renting it till it sells, sheesh.\n\nAll of my friends are in the old town. I don't have anyone here except the parents make me hate myself, because i'm homeschooling.\n\nThe scars stay longer every time.\n\nI have a good life. But apparently my mind can't take it. Apparently I can't be happy. Because I would be happy if there wasn't something wrong with my head.\n\nI was told that the feeling of emotionlessness and emptiness comes from you having too many emotions to handle. I was told so many things. No matter how much I want to cry, I can't, because i'm a boy! i'm a man! and men can't cry. I guess im the pinnacle of man, huh? Because no matter how much I want to cry, I can't. No matter if ive been sitting here, remembering every single goddamned good thing in my life, sitting here with red eyes and tears building up, I still can't cry. I guess thats whats keeping me from ending it.

In order, my girlfriend of three years leaves me \u2014 just out of the blue. Says she doesn\u2019t love me anymore. Leaves. A few weeks after that, my grandfather/father figure dies. Shortly after that, I lose my apartment because my roommate screws me over and moves out of state with little to no warning. I have no choice but to move in with my father, who I do not have the best relationship with and our personalities just fucking clash. He\u2019s an obnoxious, retired, over-the-hill frat boy and I\u2019m a sensitive, anxious, depressive INFJ. It\u2019s a cramped, small apartment where I have to sleep on two sectional couches pushed together in a back room and I also have two cats. Just when I think things can\u2019t get any worse, my favorite client (I work in the group home field) dies in my arms; she was only 34. That was 2017.\n\n2018 rolls around and I just hate life and everything else. I hate my situation. I hate everything. Summer comes and I meet this girl and a spark lights up inside me \u2014 something I haven\u2019t felt in a very long time, maybe ever. I fall for her very hard and very fast. We end up moving in together and everything is just great. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a relationship, and in life. Things finally feel good. I planned on going back to school in a few months and I saw a real future in us. I was walking on clouds. The darkness seemed behind me.\n\nThen, late November (week after Thanksgiving, I believe), she begins acting very weird and very distant. Pushes me away, says she\u2019s depressed about stuff, needs her space until it passes. I oblige at first but, from my experience, this is how girls act when they\u2019re about to leave me. So I keep prying and kind of won\u2019t leave her alone...until one night I kind of just emotionally explode. Long story short, she leaves me on a Sunday night, and is back with her ex mere days later. Did I fuck something up or was that just going to happen anyway? I have no clue...but I beat myself over it constantly.\n\nIn any case, this absolutely destroys me. I talk to my therapist and what I\u2019m saying to her convinced her that I need to be admitted to the psych ward of a local hospital (not my first stint; spent two weeks there after a suicide attempt as a teen). I spend a week there but feel worse after getting out. End up having to move back in with my father because I have nowhere else to go; I\u2019m literally living on a fucking couch. I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t eat; I end up dropping 20 pounds. I start drinking very heavily. I start getting fall down drunk at bars, literally sobbing on the floor like a child \u2014 not a 30-year-old man.\n\nI ended up falling asleep at work in January since I hardly sleep at night anymore and it cost me my job. So I became a miserable lonely heartbroken suicidal drunk with no money, no job, no real home, hanging on by a thread. All I can think about, still...is her. And how she\u2019s with him and how he has money and his own place and how she has a good job and I\u2019m this fucking nothing. I feel like I\u2019m going absolutely insane.\n\nI found a new job but it\u2019s shit and it pays even less than what I was making at my previous job. I\u2019m about to be kicked off of state insurance because I \u201cmake too much money\u201d now so I have no fucking clue how I\u2019m going to get my meds. I feel like an incompetent child. All I think about is dying, ending it, being dead. I want to die. I\u2019ve struggled with depression and mental illness my entire life and this is the lowest, darkest place I have ever been. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting here, to be honest...I just think my friends are sick of me and I feel like a burden to everybody around me. I feel like I can barely function.

But it's so important to try to stay at least physically healthy and it can help with mental health. I'm not saying it will definitely make you feel better but it just might. \n\nOne of the most important things is to stay hydrated. Keep a bottle or glass of water near on your night stand if you have days where it's too hard to get out of bed or as a good habit even if you don't. If it gets hot and you sweat when you sleep, a second bottle of Gatorade or something similar might be a good idea. \n\nYou could try going for liquid meal replacements like soylent to make sure you're getting enough nutrients. It's also a little easier to hold down and you can take small sips. It's a little expensive but so much easier if you have the funds. \n\nIf you have good friends, you could always ask them if they want to eat together with you. Personally I find it encouraging and much easier to eat more when I'm around close friends. ",

Of course this lead to greater self isolation in an effort to avoid such comments and judgements and the spiral  worsened. \nYou need to live. If you die, bad results for others are a certainty but if you live, there is the possibility for greatness to occur by your actions,greatness for yourself and others. \nLiquid meal supplements were the easiest to stomach, but keeping active made the biggest difference for me, going to the gym or going on a long walk or distracting myself in the garden helped my mental state and my appetite. \nI hope at least one of these posts makes a difference for you.

Even in the middle of the class.  My parents always hated me because of that,  they were telling me my tears were fake and I just want everybody to pity me... My grandparents were worse, I often heard from them,  that I am a slut (because I wore a light dress)  or a pest. I tend to get into psychosis,  I hurt myself in hopes physical pain will releive the mental one. I screamed my lungs out and the only thing my parents were doing is threten me to put me into asylum. Later on I was diagnosed with Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Because I tried to help people,  now I am scared to go on any convention in my country,  because people from communities that once gave me some comefort stabbed me in the back... \n\nEven so,  I always thought it's going to get better.

Home life, social life and personal life is all shit. \n\nA little background about me. I\u2019m 17 and I\u2019m transgender (Female to Male) this will come into play later. I also live in Scotland\n\nALL NAMES MENTIONED ARE NOT THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE IRL. \n\nIt all started late November, I just started to talk to my friend again after I left the friend group because of my social anxiety - which I\u2019ll go into further later. We hit it right back off and everything seemed to be going fine. The friend group consists of my best friend, Amber, My friend and Ambers boyfriend Jake, Paul and Tom. Everyone in my friend group apart from Paul and Tom know I\u2019m trans. We were back on track and were being a normal group of friends when suddenly Amber breaks up with Jake. When I ask her why, she said she was being abused and cheated on by him - I felt so sad that I didn\u2019t help her and I blame myself for not noticing earlier. We tell Jake he can\u2019t be friends with us after he did that...\n\nAs I said, I have really bad social anxiety and I am really bad in any social situation with friends - I get really paranoid about if people are actually my friend, or if I\u2019m being too annoying. I get these thoughts everyday and it sends me into a state of panic. \n\nNovember 31st: So I was sorta paranoid after Jake left as I thought he would spread around that I\u2019m trans and Out me when I really don\u2019t need to be. To get our minds off the situation me and Amber went into town and just bought some games and food. It was fun and probably the last time I was genuinely happy.\n\nDecember 5th: Amber keeps on joking about ODing on pills and she is an avid user of morphine and uses it to numb the pain when she cuts herself. I ask her to stop and I want to help and she pushes me away. Her jokes about her suicide seem real and I hurts me when she actually DID take pills - came in the next day and bragged about it knowing full well that I was trying to stop her last night and I was having a severe panic attack thinking my best friend was gone. I get really depressed after that.\n\nDecember 14th: I get invited to a New Years Party at Jack\u2019s - I\u2019m really excited, this is my first party I\u2019m evER going to and we are planning what to do and what to bring, though the same day I fail my math test.\n\nDecember 18th-20th: Amber Outed me to Tom, he is transphobic and Homophobic which make me nervous. My Parents keep on fighting and fighting and fighting and I try to drown it out with musicals.\n\nDecember 22th: Jack messaged me the day after school finished for winter break saying that I can\u2019t come to the party because I might try to rape Amber, let\u2019s remind you I don\u2019t have a dick, yet, and I don\u2019t have any interest in Amber. So I was left really shaken up. I asked amber if she thought this and she didn\u2019t reply. I was really hurt.\n\nDecember 26th: My Parents told me they are having a divorce, I had to sign a lot of paperwork, I cry myself to sleep every night. \n\nDecember 31st-Jan 1st: I see all the posts about the party - everyone looks so happy and I feel so left out and alone. I want to die. I was planning to come out today but because of the divorce I don\u2019t want to do it...\n\nNow: The first day back at school and I walk straight past my friend group and I just feel their glares and them talking behind my back. My anxiety and stress get to much and I almost have a panic attack in the middle of the class. I feel like they will put me to the whole school soon\n\nI just feel so empty, so alone and unloved my life is just hellish and with my parents divorce, my loss of friends and my anxiety and depression is just too much. I tried getting in contact with a therapist but I asked Amber and she didn\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t know where I can go.",

I have my usual up and down days. But this year has but all down. This year has been so unforgiving. The beginning of the year was semester 2 of 9th grade. I unfortunately caught the flu not once, not twice, not three, but four times. I missed a lot of school. Work piled up and i couldn't finish it all. Even with school help. Suffice it to say, i ended up failing. Thats where things got fucked.\n\n The fact that i would be doing the year over just killed me. And on top of that, in late April, i visited my mentally ill mother at her house (provided by the government) and it was traumatizing. She had no furniture, broken front door, barely any food in the fridge, one very small bedroom and a futon. That's it. Anyway, i was exploring her house and i checked under her sink. There was moldy food, roaches and flies everywhere, 3 very large empty bottles of vodka. I had no words to describe how i felt, i still dont. I left her house feeling empty inside. \n\nSummer this year was a rollercoaster ride. A very dark and rainy ride. Shortly after the last day of school. I hit rock bottom. I locked my bedroom door and didn't come out for days. Thoughts of suicide racing through my head, fuck that they were attacking my head. I had a plan and i was about to follow through when something pulled me back. I dont know what or how. But it did. So i walked away. My parents found me in my room. I was a total wreck, tears covering my entire face. I was taken to the hospital that day. And i spent 3 days there being evaluated. It was one of the most traumatizing and scary things ive ever experienced, not knowing what was in store for me.\n\n I got sent home and i got even more therapy (i had already been seeing a therapist for 6 years). Things got better and i had hope for a future. My plan was to kick ass at school and pass. But, my depression came back. Hit me like a truck. Though not in the way that you or i would expect. I didnt even realize i was depressed. I just slept all day (15-17 hours a day) all day everyday. I missed over 2 months of school. The entire first semester. Fucked. I thought i had a sleeping disorder at first. I went to see doctors and professionals about it and they said i was perfectly fine other than some easily fixable health issues. \n\nAround november, it hit me that im most likely going to be doing the 9th grade over again for the third time. I should be in 11th grade next year. Then the original symptoms of depression came back. Suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, no desire to do anything. December rolls around (merry and jollyness right?) and i had a new sense of hope. Christmas time was always my favorite time of year. Gifts and things that i want under the tree. That gave me a reason to keep going. I came to school more frequently because of that. Then winter break came.\n\nA few days ago (saturday), my grandma told me we dont have enough money for presents this year. I felt destroyed. I felt obliterated. It hit me like a nuclear bomb. Hiroshima in my head. The past few days ive just been laying in my bed not doing much. \n\nI dont feel like doing anything. I want to die, but at the same time, My birthday is in 3 months (tax return time so guaranteed presents). I want to keep going not only for my parents and the people who love me. But for myself and for those presents. I just dont know how im gonna make it through. My usual antidepressants havent been working. So i have a psychiatrist appointment in a few weeks to get new stronger meds. I have no idea how im gonna make it till then. While all my friends are super excited for Christmas tomorrow, im dreading it. I dont want to hear about their presents, that will destroy me. \n\nThere are many other factors that play into my depression that I'm experiencing right now. Too many. But i just wanted to say this because ive already told everyone i can. Everyone knows how i feel, its just a matter of me hanging on until i get new meds. ",

My daughter is probably around your age (16) and she is going through a lot of the same things you are. I know how it feels to be both in it and on the outside looking in. I know that struggling with depression makes everything in life sooooooo much harder.\n\nI don't know how i can help, but I want you to know you're not alone, even when you feel overwhelmingly alone, you're not. They say \"one day at a time\" if that's too much take a moment at a time, a second at a time even if you just go breath by breath. I'm sorry for everything you are going through, if you need someone to talk to you can reach out to me if you want.\n\nI know school is going shitty and Christmas sucks and then to see your mom struggle like that, it's all so hard.

            "patterns": "First, for months I have been thinking about opening up and telling my story on social media by the end of this year/beginning of the new. There are some close friends who know everything, well of what I will allow them to know. My mom knows I was hospitalized twice and has tried to be supportive. My dad and brother also know I was in the hospital. Other than that, a lot of my friends and family members do not know anything about it. \n\nThese past couple years, this past in particular, has been the most I have ever struggled with suicidal thoughts and attempts. I have had anxiety and depression since I could form my own thoughts in my head. I\u2019ve been on different medications since I was 13, to make a long story short.\n\nThere is so much I could dive into to possibly try to explain why I want to die, but that\u2019s not my intention for posting.  I want to post for myself. It may be selfish, and I am in no way looking for pity from others. But for some reason, I feel if I speak on social media about everything I\u2019ve been through, if everyone I know hears my story and what has happened, that I will be free. I will be free from having to lie and explain why I missed a week of school or why it took my an extra semester and a half to graduate. It will be all out there in the open. For everyone. And that relieves me and terrifies me at the exact same time.\n\nI will be vulnerable in front of everyone in the world. I will be most vulnerable to my family, who have trouble understanding depression and suicidal ideation. I guess the reason I am confessing this on here before posting on other outlets is because I\u2019m just scared. I think about doing this all the time and i really want to, I almost need to. But should I? Should I really burden my grandparents and younger brother and friends and everyone with telling them that I almost didn\u2019t make it? I almost went through with it so many times? Is it necessary for me to worry them with this confession? This may seem trivial to some, to post on social media, but for me, it\u2019s not.

                "It is ok to feel terrified about speaking your truth. The topic of mental health needs to be addressed rather than left in the dark. A burden would be lifted off your shoulders once it is over. Imagine how many lives you can change just by telling your story. Prerecord it, and once you find the courage to, then post it.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE",
                "Hmm you know your own situation better than anyone else, so my opinion on things shouldn't count for much. \n\nThing is, I wouldn't do something like this. There were some brief moments where I made my mental state somewhat public and attached my real name to things, stuff I've said personally to people when I was mentally fucked up, stuff I've said out of anxiety, a deep need to communicate, calls for help basically, and I regret many of them. Three people decided they'd rather not know me as a result. All three were different, but their reasons were similar. I've embarrassed myself a number of times. Sometimes those embarrassments are amplified in my memory more than anything changes concrete in reality. The times I judiciously decided to censor myself, hide my problems, and the people I've deliberately kept in the dark, I'm grateful for. I've learned just because I have the urge to say something doesn't mean it should be said. Just because it is honest and natural doesn't mean it's the right thing to say. \n\nStuff that is said publicly with your real name attached can follow you a long time. On the flip side, the reaction could also be underwhelming or misunderstood. Even anonymously, I've said some things I thought felt right in my head, only to have them received poorly by others. \n\nI don't know. Again don't take me too seriously, use your own best judgment, but I refer to these things as \"crying in public\". Of course you'll get some degree of attention, but at the same time, you're also revealing your vulnerabilities to everyone you know. Once the information is out there, you can't control it. People you'd prefer not to know may indirectly find out. \n\nThe way I go about things (or at least learned to) is to treat yourself privately, professionally, and keep your public perception stable. It's okay to reveal your deepest secrets to those you can trust, but the level of sharing should be proportionate to the strength of the relationship, as well as the character of the recipient. \n\nFor problems that basically \"blow over\", it's even better to keep them private. For example, I've had marital problems. I told people I could trust about it, but advertising those problems to the public or being loose with whom I shared it to could've had lasting negative consequences. I'm glad I kept it on lockdown, because I was able to resolve the situation privately anyway. \n\nAnother example is sharing my health condition with coworkers and my boss. I never did, because I'm worried I'll be seen as unreliable, less capable, or handicapped. Until I'm actually unable to do the work, I plan on keeping it that way. It also separates personal drama from a professional environment.\n\nIt all comes down to sharing judiciously. Is mental health a part of your identity you'd like to showcase, or is it a health condition you battle privately with the aid of those you can trust? Both good and bad can come from this. I won't tell you not to, just how I handle this topic.",
                "Thank you so much. This means more than you can imagine!! It\u2019s been a long year to say the least.",
                "Thank you for your honest and well written responses! I can see where you\u2019re coming with certain things and it makes a lot of sense. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely done similar things, only allowing others to know what I want them to and what i think is appropriate for them to know. I did have to tell my old boss (it was a work study through my school but I\u2019m graduating now) at my last job at a nonprofit about both of my hospitalizations this past year because obviously I missed those weeks. I was worried they\u2019d treat me differently or fire me as well. Luckily, they were the most understanding and even shared their own struggles. I was blessed to work at an amazing place like that because not everyone is so understanding. But then again, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to work somewhere that belittled me or let me go because of my mental health.\n\nAs for going so public with this information, you\u2019re definitely right about a lot of things. Once it\u2019s out there, literally everyone will know everything about it and I can\u2019t unshare it with people I don\u2019t want to see it. But like I stated above as well, if I have friends, family, professional opportunities/colleagues, now and in the future, who decide to not be in my life anymore or not hire me because I struggle personally with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, do I really want those people or opportunies in my life anyways? \n\nI do worry people will take it as looking for attention on social media. Heck even I have thought that about people I\u2019m friends with when they continue to post depressing things. I have realized I know that there are people who will think this about me once I do this. There are always people going to look down on you for using social media as an outlet to tell your story about your struggles. But I\u2019ve also realized that I need to forget about those people. My story could really help someone else, even someone I don\u2019t know. It could help someone decide to go to the hospital instead of going through with it, or help someone open up to their parents and friends like I did. \n\nAgain, thank you for your response. I love communicating with others and seeing situations from both sides (I graduated with a Communication Studies degree so this is good!). \n\nHope you have a great new year!",
                "To be honest I've felt the same way at times. If people are going to reject you because you have problems, are they even worth keeping in your life? I'd responses \"no\" too. At the same time I don't feel I have the confidence or stability to make calls like that. For me dealing with my problems internally or with those I can trust is enough to keep my hands full, let alone everyone else's opinions on the matter. Plus in my experience I've mostly encountered apathy, if not judgement and misunderstanding. You seem to possess the confidence that I lack. I'm glad despite all of the potential negatives I brought up you're still resolute. I hope it goes well for you.",
                "Confidence is definitely something you can learn and work on! I\u2019ve found it amazing to see so many more people talking about their stories today, through social media, the internet, and in person, than there was even 5 years ago. I think the more we talk about mental illnesses, the more it\u2019ll become accepted as legit. It\u2019s still hard though, people will always judge. But thanks again! I still haven\u2019t decided whether I should tell my story or if I\u2019m even ready to, but I\u2019m glad for conversations like these!"

She even ignored me because I said I was depressed and this was just after explaining that I felt no one was there for me.
