I've struggled with depression/anxiety for a long time, but I've never had as concrete an idea of how I would do it until now. And that really scares me.  \n\n\nI have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and I feel like it's deteriorating my normal level of function. I have considered myself high-functioning for a long time. I've been in and out of therapy (currently out) for years, but it's never been helpful. \n\nTherapists have told me I seem very self-aware, but that I'm closed off. It's a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if it's negative. So this is really hard for me, to post like this. I'm hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.   \n\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this. I don't want them to know, or blame themselves, or worry. But the dissociation and suicide ideation are getting really bad, and I don't know what to do.",

I haven\u2019t seen anyone about it though, so I\u2019m not sure. There\u2019s a lot of things happening right now in my life, which I won\u2019t go into to much detail here but I know that\u2019s a factor. I found out that a lot of my close friends have attempted suicide and/or/were depressed, and I\u2019m the type of person who wants to help them. One of these people is my crush, and although I know that it probably isn\u2019t  my fault, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I should be doing more. Their friends have pretty much written it off as them needing attention, etc., so I\u2019m one of the few people that is really there for them (at least the way I see it). The problem is, that person doesn\u2019t talk that much and I don\u2019t know what to do to help them. So now, I\u2019m stressing over them, my other friends, and the other more personal things going on in my life, and I can feel myself slipping. I\u2019ve tried doing what I usually like doing to try and stop the decent, like playing my favorite video games, hanging out with friends, etc., but it doesn\u2019t make me happy. I\u2019ve been eating less too, which judging by what I\u2019ve read online is a sign. What I\u2019m trying to say is, I need help. I don\u2019t know what I should do, I don\u2019t want to slip into a depression because my family is already stressed enough. So I turn to the internet, does anyone have any advice on how to go about stopping this before it gets too bad and noticeable?",

Yeah it was a metal spoon I threw at, I did that in frustration like I was going crazy and didn\u2019t know how to stop. BUT it was an unfair game of what happen because I got ripped off after I helped him pay his internet bill, but it was an agreement. and he fucking acted like we never agreed on it. \n\nbut not only that I threw the spoon at him, he fucking splashed his hot coffee right at my face and also attacked me when I was covering my face in pain. \n\nI can\u2019t keep the story straight because RIGHT NOW i\u2019m losing myself in my own fucking head. \n\nAnd sometimes I just want to end it all and ignore all the bullshit and worry about after life. \n\nIf God loves us, then why does he allow sin to happen? Like most people are stuck and don\u2019t have hope for shit like that. If Jesus died for our sins, then why did he came back alive? \n\nI don\u2019t care if I receive death for mockery, because I feel like life isn\u2019t fair. And I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m delusional for saying shit like this. because I was ONCE a believer and a follower, i\u2019ve lost soo many friends and love ones close to me when I used to be a believer and while I was in bad shape during that clinical depression bullshit. Imagine losing friends when you have depression, it hits you hard in the fucking heart. \n\nand Heaven and Hell? I don\u2019t care if I get my ass beaten many times for blasphemy. It\u2019s just the way how God\u2019s world works. \n\nand if I feel like i\u2019m being deceived by some sort of satan type bullshit, then why hasn\u2019t something protected me? \n\nI\u2019ve been treated unfairly as a child when I grew up, I remember so clearly when I first started contemplating suicide at age 11.

            "question": "Hey there friends :)\n\nI posted this on r/SuicideWatch but I figured maybe it belonged here too :) \n\nIf you're here that means you're probably hurting a lot right now and I want to start of by saying that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're going through this, you don't deserve it and you're important to me. Every single one of you.\n\nI'm also really sorry that I can't take your pain away. If I could, I would take it in a heartbeat, I don't even care that I would have to deal with it. You guys on here are my main priority. \n\nI've spent a lot of my time on here, messaging people to try to help and the things that you're dealing with are intense. I truly understand everything that you're feeling and it's all valid. You aren't 'weird' or 'wrong' , these feelings are very real and it's so so hard to be fighting with yourself all the time.\n\nI want you all to know that if I could, I'd give you a big hug and let you know that you're worthy and important and that it's going to be okay, even though it feels like the complete opposite right now. \n\nAs someone who has and still is struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm, I understand it's hard to just 'not' have them. Self harm is as hard to quit as smoking or drinking, because it \"relieves\" pain for a short while, while building it up in the background that leads to it becoming an unhealthy addiction. \n\nI know how hard mental illness hits, and while seeing a doctor/therapist/psychologist is a great option, I know that it's hard to make that step. You might not be ready to talk. You might not be able to afford it. You might not be able to get to one by yourself. I understand. But talking about it is proven to help manage things. I can't solve your problems or take them away, however much I want to, but I can make sure you don't go through this alone. \n\nYou can talk to me about anything whenever, no judgement on reddit or discord. \n\nMy reddit is u/I_have_a_cold_soul \n\nMy Discord is I_have_a_cold_soul #3036\n\nA list of international suicide hotline numbers: https://ibpf.org/resource/list-international-suicide-hotlines\n\nMessage me if you're struggling or if you aren't. I want to know, how are you doing today? \n\nOnce again, you guys are strong and brave and I'm proud of you endless amounts for fighting everyday, you're such a good job. \nYou're great people going through terrible times and that's why you aren't going to do it alone. \n\nStay strong :) \n\nMax",

No matter what you will always be misunderstood by some people, ignore them, if I found a way out, you will too. Feelings are learnt, we feel more remorse when our parents or lovers or siblings are hard or controlling on us. But you can fight back! I have a pro trick for you, that might enpower you: We have one shot, and it is actually liberating, because we can do whatever the fuck we want to do in life. Without getting embarassed. It helps not to feel that feeling. Which is JUST. A. FEELING. Everyone starts as a beginner. We have to take that shot. Successful people do what they want to. I have other trick too pls change your mind related to mental power and beauty, but skills are more important. Maybe get a MBTI personality test and you will feel more understood and not alone. Listen to Neffex songs, they will help, they are my role models, their thinking: https://youtu.be/j2GKIjrkZz0\nFollow a healthy diet exercising all helps :)\nJust ask me anything\n\nI am an Infp mediator personality i just love to help.

Grieving comes in stages though, which you have to remember when you're going through it.\n\nDenial and shock.\nThis is a stage where you feel numb and try to believe differently. The world becomes a little bit meaningless and empty. You feel numb and wonder if you can go on. It shows just how strong you are, and proving that you are strong when you get through it. \n\nAnger. \nAnger at what happened. Anger at the person who died. Strong anger. It feels endless but it's not. It will dissipate, I promise. You'll get through this. \n\nBargaining. \nTrying to bargain by saying things like 'if I devote my life to helping others, then I can wake up and find out that this is a dream' and you get lost in a thought cycle of 'what if'. This can be a hard stage, but I promise you it will pass. \n\nDepression. \nIt is a reaction to almost accepting that your loves one is gone. It's completely understandable, and it will pass but you might need a little bit extra help during this stage. You don't need to go through it alone,im always here if you need to message or rant or anything. This is a necessary stage unfortunately. \n\nAcceptance. \nThis is where you accept that they actually are gone. As you begin to enjoy your life again, you might deem like you are betraying them. You aren't doing anything wrong, the person who is deceased would have wanted you to have fun. \n\nI'm sorry if that wasn't helpful. I don't want to feed you misinformation,i need to be truthful. This will be a hard journey, but you won't be going through it alone. Message me anytime, feeling good or bad. I'm here for you, and I believe in you. You're extremely important to me.

But I am saying, she might need a second chance from you. Don't do anything youll regret is what im trying to say.\n\nI would recommend stopping looking at the articles.

When I say \"best friend,\" I mean, like, we're probably going to end up living together when we are elderly because neither of us are going to have kids, lol. We're very close.\n\nHer mom was driving with her sister in the passenger's seat, and they were turning at an intersection (a large intersection with traffic lights), and a guy coming from the other direction decided that he didn't want to wait at that red light so he used the turn lane to go around and he t-boned them as them were turning. My friend's aunt died on impact, and her mom didn't make it to the hospital. The guy driving the car survived, and I think he's in jail probably for the rest of his life. He had cocaine in his system, or something, and he had no driver's license, and it wasn't his car, and he had previous big charges, etc... It feels so unfair that he gets to live. That sense of unfairness was very prominent in my feelings for a long time and I was so angry. I still get angry. I'm usually not a person that gets angry.\n\nYou have a right to mourn. He was a part of your life, even if it wasn't as much recently as it had been in the past. Jeez, my friend's mom was hardly a part of my life, but I still find myself sometimes randomly breaking down in grief. Writing this is hard. I'm around people so I'm trying my best to hold back the tears. It has been over a year, and here's how I'm feeling:\n\nHer mom has gifted me a few things over the years - I'm currently sipping coffee out of a mug that she was getting rid of, and which my friend gave to me after she died because she knew that her mom wanted to give it to me. (I collect mugs - it's really nothing special, but it's one that I used every time I went over to visit.) I have a practically vintage slow cooker that still works well, which she gave me when I moved into my first apartment after my divorce and ensuing homelessness. I have a small black bookshelf which she got for me as a wedding gift. They are completely mundane items, but right now, these things that normally just blend into the background shine bright in my life, because my brain is like \"she gave you that!\" I don't know if it's good or bad that this is happening.\n\nI'm 28 years old and have not experienced much death yet. As I was driving my friend home from her mom's funeral last year, I found out that my former best friend and boyfriend had committed suicide. Damn, it was a difficult time. I cried many times every day for quite a while. I met with his girlfriend the next time she was in town and we talked and it brought me a little closure, and I was able to bring her some closure as I have experience with depression and suicidal ideation (I've been hospitalized 3 times - I think I convinced her that it wasn't her fault).\n\nGotta be honest - you're gonna feel like shit for a while. Even if you weren't close friends recently, it will be a bigger impact than you might be expecting. Just, take care of yourself. I can't stress that enough. You have to take care of yourself above all else, right now. \n\nPlease feel free to PM me any time. This stuff is nuts to deal with, man. I don't know how old you are and how much death you have seen in your life, but no death is small and I hope that you allow yourself to feel what you are feeling. Don't deprive yourself of the grief. It's really important.\n\nI'm serious about PMing me. Hang in there. &lt;3",

Women unanimously say no. Now and then a man will admit he's thought of it. Deep down, I think people contemplate it all the time. Or I am abnormal. One or the other.\n\nI am married with kids. I am actually a very happy and well-adjusted, fulfilled human being. It's not that I 'think' about suicide, but I feel the 'urge' to kill myself. On a plane, I fantasize about it crashing. If I am in a building, I fantasize about jumping off of it. It's just an urge. I went to a bar tonight and saw a ton of amazing women. I felt an urge to sleep with each one I saw, but it doesn't mean I acted on it. These are just urges. I accept that. I also accept I'm an adult who can pick and choose which urges he acts on. That's what separates me from an ape. Actually, apes control their urges better than some humans I know. \n\nYou'll be absolutely fine and you're normal. It doesn't mean your crazy. Depending on the therapist you go to, they will tell you what I've told you- that people have these thoughts and urges. Some therapists will tell you you're wacky and need a pill to fix you. Everyone has to choose their own path- so pick yours. But know that it's ok to feel that way. It's your mind's way of telling you you're getting stale and need new challenges. If you're pursuing a new venture in life or seducing a new mate, you're most likely not suicidal; know what I mean?\n\nGood luck.\n\nAlso, this song always helps me feel better:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYItTxqTc38",

A complete failure. Extremely lonely, no close friends &amp; if I were to die tomorrow, nobody (except my husband) would even notice or care.\n\nI\u2019m passively suicidal because I do not take care of myself. Have had pre-cancerous cells in my body removed before, but haven\u2019t been to the doctor in over 10 years. Supposed to get a colonoscopy but haven\u2019t done it because I just don\u2019t care. Should see a dermatologist, too but I won\u2019t.  So if I get a bad diagnosis, I will absolutely do nothing to treat it and I won\u2019t tell anyone. So by inaction, I\u2019m hopeful that I can hurry death and end the pain. I absolutely do NOT want to live to a ripe old age.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sick and tired of Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d posting about mental health and that they\u2019re offering a \u201csafe space.\u201d Those flaming hypocrites never bother to return my calls and don\u2019t respond to my messages (and that\u2019s just friendly texts to say hello \u2014 I\u2019m not asking for anything). I keep reaching out, but it gets me nowhere &amp; I\u2019m about ready to give up. But when I isolate my depression just gets worse.\n\nSo I understand about thinking of suicide and I\u2019m sorry for the pain you feel. You get more sympathy from a broken arm and the accompanying pain because it\u2019s tangible: x-rays and MRIs confirm there\u2019s something broken and people can relate to the pain. \n\nBut the pain of a broken soul, in my opinion, is far worse. No one tells you to \u201cjust get over\u201d a broken arm but, when you\u2019re depressed and having a rough time, it\u2019s all \u201cJust get over yourself!\u201d \u201cGo for a walk!\u201d \u201cStop dwelling on it!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing this to yourself!\u201d \n\nHope someone out there understands.

I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. \n\nFast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. \n\nI just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. \n\n  \nI struggle very hard not to let the thought of \"ending it all so they'll be better of\" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?\n\n  \nI should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session won't be for another 2 weeks.",

I use CBT to deal with my negative and it\u2019s helping, but I really think if you find a therapist , a good therapist, they can help with your struggles, but right now call the helpline and believe in yourself, you can do everything just break in pieces and do one by one, anxiety + depression are hard to deal but you are not alone. \n\nAhhh and eat healthy and drink water, this make difference, and first step after the helpline, to break anxiety + depression.",
                "It can be very hard to be financially secure, or finish school, get a better job, etc. while experiencing depression. Really everything is harder, but those are things I've struggled with a lot. \n\nI know when I'm in a bad state all aspects of cognition are dulled. \n\nThere are a lot of details that are missing to really give advice. I would ask things like: what kind of support do you mean? I'm familiar with medical insurance covering kids until around that age but that's all I really know about. \n\nAlso, what are you doing in therapy? ie CBT, making \"action\" plans to get to a better place (financially &amp; emotionally).\nHave you made any progress? \nYou didn't mention medication, have you seen a psychiatrist? \n\nI mean, I think the only answer from my perspective is really to get a better job to either be able to contribute or move out. I am in the states, American, I got the impression you are somewhere else from your vocabulary. I mention this only because cultures differ in regard to living with your parents among other things. \n\nAlso, how did you find out? If you were told by a parent, this is probably their way of trying to motivate you. \n\nThat being said, if you are stuck in a depressive state, getting a better job can be anywhere from hard to impossible. For me it's the interviews, and replying to ads that say things like \"must be awesome\". Usually once I'm engaged in something, it can be an escape until it gets boring. \n\nRegardless, I think the alleviation of your symptoms is obviously the most important thing. So if one therapeutic approach isn't working, try another. Then next is usually medication. Generally I suck at life, but when I have excelled, or maintained competency, it has been the result of the right therapeutic approach and the right medication, leading to enacting a plan that enables me to engage with the world. So, for me that looks like: having a job, social connections, being physically active, intellectual stimulation, all the things humans need I suppose.",
                "Have you tried medication? While it isn't usually the fix (although some people do require long-term medication), it can help you get to a point where it is easier to sort everything out and put other help into place. Without it, I would have had a hard time leaving the house, let alone working.\n\nYou may be helped by looking into behaviour/thought \"modification\" tools likes CBT, mindfulness, and meditation, as well as taking slow steps to help get yourself into a better place - exercise, regular sun exposure, learning how you learn best, and doing things you can do to ease the burden on your parents. This may not be financial, it may be doing extra work around the house, but it'll help settle your mind a little.\n\nJust know that things can get better, and although the road is long and arduous, they will get better if you put in effort to do that. I know how difficult that is, but every step you take (even making your bed in the morning, or drinking more water) is a step towards a better you. Anytime you start thinking about suicide go and do something that makes the world just a little bit better for someone else. It isn't a fix all, but distraction and satisfaction are wonderful tools in your toolbox.\n\nLastly, music is your friend. This may sound odd, but music is one of best things you can employ to alter your mood. It literally saved me from myself. \n\nTry not to be too harsh on yourself. We all move at different paces, and that's okay. You're okay as you are in this moment of time, because in this moment you can't change who you are - you can only change the future you. That is the you that should be your focus, because that is the you that you will become. \n\nI know that it is easy to feel disheartened when you look at where everyone else is, but you aren't them. As long as you are taking steps to make yourself just a little bit better than you were yesterday (bearing in mind that is okay to slip), then it's okay. Rome wasn't built in a day, and all of that jazz.\n\nLastly, think about what you have achieved. You have a job. You're still trying to achieve. You're recognised there is a problem. You've reached out for help. You got out of bed this morning. You, presumably, brushed your teeth. You possibly made your bed. Etc.",

                "Thanks for replying,  \n\n\nIn my country parents are paid money to support them for every child they have below the age of 25. Parents in my country are in that time basically forced to support their children so they can finish university or training for a certain job.   \nAdditionally, I'm not paying health insurance, as long as I'm supported like that, my father's insurance covers for me. This will change, one I'm turning 25. And my Mother just told me I don't make enough money to insure myself. And she can't do it either. We just bought a house together, because my sister had a mental illness, and my parents were worrying she might never be able to work. But she is. She has a son now, and she seems perfectly fine. A little helpless at times, but I guess everyone is.  \nAll my savings are in that little partial flat I got, but I'm basically expected to move out eventually.   \n\n\nI have no idea what I'm doing in therapy. I'm basically just talking and or crying. I can't even tell you the difference between a psychiatrist and a therapist. I know he has a medical degree, if that helps?   \n\n\nI don't mind the ads, I'm straight up scared of not being able to get up everyday to go to work. With university it's not that big of a deal to miss a class.  \n\n\nHow do I choose the correct approach?",
                "Thank you for replying  \nI'm really aweful with phone calls. What is CBT? How do I know if my therapist is good?",
                "CBT= cognitive behavioural therapy, for me is working. \nYou need click with your therapist, you need feel free to tell everything your negative thoughts making you feel and put in words or drawing..... and tell without feeling awkward or shame .\nGood therapist/psychologist help to identify what is happening, if you need evaluation to an underlying problem like learning disabilities or clinical depression or other problem. Therapist/psychologist help you.\nThe helpline line is okay, it is really easy to talk if you are alone and nobody can listen - if I think someone is near I close totally or I cannot express, but if you don\u2019t like is okay , but if you in despair , despair and cannot talk with a therapist/psychologist so call it is good.",
                "So I don't exactly understand how the financial situation you're describing works. It seems very different from anything I know about. \n\nEverything that follows is info that pertains to persons in the states: If you're Dr. prescribed medication and has a medical degree, then he would be a psychiatrist. This would make him explicitly not a therapist at all. However, if you quit the meds because they didn't work but were not prescribed an alternative, this is also confusing because a psychiatrist is for prescribing and monitoring medical treatment for mental illnesses:  Medication, and other things, newer treatments like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. A good psychiatrist will also ask about your life, and get a feel for how things are going but this is in regard to the treatment/ medication. They will also encourage you to get a therapist.\nTherapist is a term that can cover a few different positions but what you want is a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, something like that. This is someone who went to school for psychology, and focused on the clinical aspect (patient interaction), and they usually specialize in something like trauma, depression/anxiety, addiction, etc. \n\nHonestly, I would say you should really look into the mental health system in your country, and be able to understand what is what. Are there public services, that are free or reduced? You are your best advocate and being informed is the way to be able to fulfill this role.\n\nIn my opinion this is incredibly important. \n\nAlso, have you asked your sister about her experience, and if she has any advice? \n\nOut of curiosity, how long did you try the medication? \nWas it only one trial of one dosage or did you try different dosages? \n\nI think you should try to study a bit the different approaches to depression. Everything from psychological/ therapeutic approaches to antidepressant drug classes. This will aid you in communicating with professionals in the future and probably give you some hope. Even just reading through all of Wikipedia's info on the subject (pertinent info) would help. \n\nProfessionals deserve respect, of course, however they don't always have the right answer, or the insight for your specific situation. It is perfectly fine to get a second or twenty second perspective. Specifically, with psychologists &amp; psychiatrists it can be harder to develop a good relationship. Not friendly, but an intimate, trusting relationship where you feel the other person understands. They should be able to paraphrase your feelings and concerns to demonstrate this at least. \n\nTo give you one example, and this is my personal experience, I have seen 5-10 Psychiatrists and about 10-15 therapists (some I paid cash, some through insurance, some were public/free). Some of the therapists were counselors, some clinical psychologist, some addiction specialists. \nThis is over a 12 year span.\nOf these, I had 2 great psychiatrists, and 2 great therapists. The rest may have been great for other people, but no relationship was established, some therapists just listened to me and provided no feedback. I would say it's similar to finding a significant other to some degree. So...you may have to meet several before you really like one. \n\nBut, I would really stress learning about the resources available to you and the basics of depression and it's treatment.",

But no, I'm supposed to just sit there and talk about how I feel. Or how I felt during the past 2 weeks. I feel like I'm missing the most important things and so in the end waist time, that could be put to use helping me.

                "No that's fine. Vent as much as you wish. Unfortunately, any condition or disease that is serious enough to interfere with your daily life functions is going to require a time commitment that is unfair to the sufferer. This is one of those things that is out of our control and acceptance is the only logical answer. I have learned a lot, there have been times when I didn't really think much about depression, then other times when that is all I could think about. I, and everyone I know or has spoken to about mental health has to spend a considerable more about of self care time to just be ok. It sucks. But the alternative sucks worse. \n\nAt one point in my life I faced the very real possibility that I would have to have kidney dialysis, I guess twice a week or so, for the remainder of my life. I regained function after a three week period while still in the hospital, so very lucky, but it's a similar thing you know...if I had to keep going, I had to keep going, or I imagine I would die some terrible death. I believe I would slowly be poisoned by my own body. \n\nThis, depression, for me at least, is the same, but the poison is in the mind, and tries to hide in logic, rationale, but if you write or speak your thoughts, it's usually easily distinguished. So, yes, vent, tell ppl, write, keep a journal, let it out, you know. \n\nSorry for the late reply, I sleep for a couple days/weeks  here and there."

There\u2019s just no good way to remove yourself from this world once you\u2019ve started existing. Yes, it\u2019s good to think through the philosophical and social impact killing yourself would have. You need to structure your worldview with some perspective (because the depression insists on skewing it for you).

Many of the people you feel hate you probably dont understand what you are going through.

                "It can take time to get over an ex. I have definitely been there. So right now you are experiencing very vivid memories of your ex which in itself isn't really a problem. The reason why you are feeling so depressed is because you are strongly rejecting your current situation. You are saying a big no! I do not want what I have right now. I do not want to be experiencing this very moment and I do not want to accept it as it is. This strong resistance and rejection to your current situation and the wanting to recapture and experience the past that does not exist anymore (only as thoughts and images) is causing you to feel very depressed. At the moment you are not willing to let go of your ex so therefore are unable to let go of all the thoughts and images that you have of her. So to put it simply, you are suffering because you want something other than what life has given to you. And the stronger your attachment is to your thoughts and images and the more you resist your current life, the greater you will suffer.",

All I am saying is that it helps to understand the mechanics of your suffering. Thoughts are not the problem, not always being present is the problem. The problem occurs when we have a strong desire to re live our past through our minds in a way to escape our current situation. \n\nYou start to find acceptance when you start to say yes to life and not try to escape it. Make friends with your current experience. Whatever you doing right now, accept everything completely as it is like you have chosen it. Fully and I mean fully!embrace and accept every thought, image, and feeling that you are experiencing right now. And be aware of all your senses, of smell, touch, sight etc. If you start to do this you will begin to transform your life, slowly but surely. Have the courage to face fully whatever is going on for you right now. Don't run, face it without fear. Always take yourself back to the present moment, the only moment that you will ever experience, and what life wants you to experience.",

            "answer": [
                "To be blunt why are you writing on a depression help sub for a suicide note? That doesn't make sense.  I get it you're going through rough patch mentally. The people that you thought are your \"friends and family\" aren't helping you the way they should. If you have told them about you're internal struggles most people usually get uncomfortable because it's out of their bubble of comfort, and won't know  or understand how to help, ease or assist you're issues. \n\nIt's crazy to say with this information you have posted, this is okay. It's only letting you know who's really there for you  if it's nobody let it be so. Why stress over people who don't care, not trying to hear you out or have not bothered taking the time out of their day to respond to your messages. \n\nWriting a note shows that you care and you want to leave something on the part of this world. Why would you decide to kill yourself knowing that a part you have something to give and wanting to leave a mark? I'm not going to give you the \"you're loved\" crap but all i can say is think about it several times and makes sure you're heart aligns with your thoughts. Once you're gone there is no turning back. \n\nYes, corny message, but well thought out message. The best thing i can say is just take the time out of your days to breathe, relax, reflect on the past(don't run, fight you're demons), think about the now and contemplate on a plausible future.  \n\nI'm really no different from you. Everyday seems like i want to push myself of the edge but I decide to stay and fight each day for the better or the worse.",
                "Im posting it here because idk where else to post it, r/suicidewatch ignores me and so does r/depression\n\nAnd ive beem thinking about it for over a year now, i just didnt have the courage to do it, but life has gotten so bad that i just cant be afraid anymore",
                "I was going to tell you to just not write the note, but I wanted to tell you something else instead. I've been where you are, and I'm still there. I've written suicide notes multiple times and I realised very few things could stop me from writing them in those moments. \n\nIn my notes, I always wrote about everything I was feeling at the moments. Sometimes I changed audiences, sometimes I wrote to no one in particular. I don't think there's any structure to a note like that. But in the end writing everything made me realise that whatever I wrote, it wasn't going to be enough. Because it never made me satisfied, never gave me what I was looking for. I still don't know what I'm looking for, but I do know writing those notes helped.\n\nSo write you 'suicide note', write about how miserable you feel, about how angry you are, about how you wanted help, or how you don't care anymore. Write about everything like there's no barriers, and write till your hand hurts. I know you said you don't want to write about your anger, but just fucking do it. Why not? It's the last thing you think you'll ever write. But don't kill yourself. \n\nI know that's what you're planning on doing, and you probably don't want to hear this, but please just don't. At least personally, I've learned that writing helps actually. Every suicide note I've written and thrown away makes me realise how hurt I am, how much I don't want to kill myself. How much I just want someone to help. Because when you think you're in your last moments, and you're counting down, sometimes that's the moment when you can be most honest with yourself. Instead of killing myself, I ended up using that as a way to be honest with myself when I don't want to think anymore. \n\nTry and reach out for help, go to mental health helplines for your country, forums; I can give you numbers and websites and apps. There's still a lot for you to live for. I'm not talking about changing the world; I'm talking about that band you really like, or a movie you really wanted to watch. I know you're angry and hurt, but no one can live your life for you, no one likes the exact same things you do. You have a place in this world. Reach out to a professional, talk to them about your suicide note too; they might tell you things you didn't even know about yourself. \n\nIn the end, I can't stop you from doing anything. But I hope some of what I'm saying makes sense to you. And I'm sorry for everything you've been through.",

And i dont want to kill myself because i have nothing i want to do, on the contrary i have so much i want to do but the idea of going through it without her hurts and i dont want to live in that future, the idea of her with someone else makes me want to cut myself until my arms are shredded and i know she is with someone else. The thought of her having sex with someone makes me want to blow my brains out. And i think about this every single day. I cant take this anymore, i cant take being without her, i cant take the idea of her ruining her life because i know she is bad at making decisions thats why i wanted her with me so i could protect her from making them and help her live a life she wouldnt regret. But i ended up being the one with a life i regret.",
                "I know you want to protect her, but you also need to understand that she's her own person and is completely independent of you. No matter what her relationship is to anyone else, she is her own person, and if she makes bad decisions, you can't change that. You can only help her as much as she allows. There is a point where you need to draw and the line and try to move on. You care about her, but are you seeing what it's doing to you?\n\nYou need to live for yourself first before you can life for anyone else. I can only imagine the kind of pain you're in, but again, there's so so much more for you. Right now, I know it feels like there's nothing you can do and no life without this girl, but that's not the truth. You don't stop living your life because of your pain. On the contrary, you continue to push and live through because of it.\n\nYour experience with counsellors and helplines sounds so shitty, and I've had some of that. When I first started trying helplines, none of them picked up. I tried every few weeks for almost 3 years, and only one picked up. I know how it feels, but there are other ways. I can give you some resources that might work, like 7cups is an amazing website if you need someone to talk to. There's some helplines I know that work, and I can find some more for you if you tell me which country you live in.\n\nIf you can afford some money, why not hire a therapist? Again, a shitty as it is, none of the help you reach out for is guaranteed, but you need to keep trying. If your therapist calls you a pussy, tell them to start doing their jobs and fuck off, then delete their number. You don't need that bullshit in your life.\n\nKeep trying your best to find a professional, and get their advice. You can also just try and search up hospitals near you with a psychiatry department and book an appointment. At the very least, you'll get more info on resources. \n\nPlease don't give up. If it feels too hard, take some rest, go somewhere you feel comfortable whether it's a cafe or a friends place. Do something tiny you like, find some more strength and keep pushing. That's all I can tell you. You need to keep trying, especially because you said there's so many things you want to do. Just try doing one of those things without this girl, even if it's painful. It will get better, somehow. Even if that's not the truth, it's something you have to believe if you want to get around to doing any of those things you wanted.",
                "I know she is her own person and i didnt try to stop her from making decisions just really bad ones, i cant get into details but she has made decisions that fucked her up severely and i wanted to stop her from doing it again\n\nIve been to hospitals they just kick me out and point me to a therapist\n\nAnd i dont have many friends and the ones i do have are online and they ignore me.\n\nAnd i dont want to do those things if theres no reason, she is my reason.",
                "I know you don't want to hear this, I know. But in the last month I have buried two people who took their lives. People who were absolutely in your position, but as much as it may not feel like it, there ARE people who care, people who will be heartbroken to lose you. In both cases, the ripples were felt and their loss was and is painful. \n\nI have been there, I swear I have, and I won't feed you bullshit about it's all going to be sunshine and roses, but this darkness won't last, I promise. It's not fake, its from experience. From someone who has been hospitalized, who has been so deep in depression there wasn't light anywhere, it won't last.",
                "Everyone always says that i have someone even when they dont know me, trust me, no one cares about me, and even if they did they wouldnt be the person who i need to care for me",

I care that you are hurting and things have been shitty for you, and that right now the only way you see out is death. Like I said, I've been there. I struggled for a long time. Your experiences with therapists are trash, and I had those as well. But I also found one who was incredible and worked with me as much as I needed for as long as I needed to find the light. It's hard work, but especially after the last month I am so glad I'm still here, as cheesy as it sounds."

I know that suicide solves nothing but I still feel horrible. I am about to start my Sophomore Year in high school soon and I have never been so self conscious and worried. First things first, my body. It's the typical teenage complaint but I get so worked up over it. I sound stupid because I am skinny but my mind won't allow me to believe that. I get worried over my arms and legs because I feel they are huge. I don't know why I can't just accept it. I don't know why. Another thing, I am so self conscious of my personality and opinions. I have a huge problem with my social anxiety to the point where I can't even communicate with my father well. I am not hated at my school and I don't sit in the corner but in my head I am always thinking about how stupid I sound or look doing things. I get scared speaking and bringing myself into conversation. When I do interact, I either try too hard and sound like an annoying air-head or I get very shy and make mistakes. One of my biggest flaws is that when I like someone, friend or crush or blah blah blah, I tend to try to think just like them. I change my opinions on things just to please them. I suddenly have to do everything to agree with them. I hate that. Finally, I have never had a boyfriend. This one is the thing that I am least worried about but it still bugs me. I know I am still a bit young to be dating but EVERY SINGLE PERSON in my grade has dated someone at least ONCE besides me. It's makes me sad. And it makes me sad that no one has ever showed any interest either. Other girls just naturally have boyfriends like its in their DNA. I don't know what's wrong with me..

Are these people good enough for me to hang out with and talk to? are they interesting enough? its about your enjoyment of life and experiences.\n\nAlso: \"get out of their minds and just be in your own\" so basically at a party i would be anxious about people and everything, but then when i would tell myself that, it wasnt about what anyone else was thinking, it was about me and what i wanted to do, what i wanted to say. If i wanna go pick up that object and look at it coz its weird, then thats what ill do because im alive and im going to enjoy my life for me, live my life for me. Idk if youre an imaginative type, but i am and imagining my mind closing up and me only existing within my own head helped. rather than me trying to figure out what others were thinking.\n\nand also, with your sadness, youre allowed to feel what you feel. theres no right or wrong reason to be sad, feelings demand to be felt. so let them be felt and expressed somehow, but stay away from ruminating. \n\nKeep up your amazing effort"

I\u2019m just afraid that if I don\u2019t really try to say this properly, then it\u2019ll go to that place and this moment will be just one more thing I let float away from me. And I suppose this whole post will probably be as self-absorbed and over-described and rehashed as I\u2019m worried it will sound. Probably even more than that. But I couldn\u2019t give a shit anymore, because more than afraid of what I\u2019m going to sound like, and how I\u2019m coming across, and what people might think of me, more than any of that, I\u2019m just tired. And I\u2019m sad. And I want to get off this ride I\u2019ve been taking myself on for way too long. And I know that probably sounds like a pretty ominous start to a post on a subreddit filled with some pretty ominous posts, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not going to be like that. This ain\u2019t gonna end with someone needing to call an ambulance. Not fucking today. \n\nBut first, an intro.\n\nIf you ask me on any other day, I\u2019ll say I see myself as a basically lump of a person. As a meat sack. I imagine myself sometimes as like a piece of soft and sagging flesh, like the human equivalent of that part under the arm that jiggles when you move. And my greatest fear is that I\u2019m going to sit on this couch and waste until I eventually kill myself, or until the world moves on and I\u2019m left sort of stuck here in my own pocket of time. And then I kill myself. And honestly, a lot of the time suicide seems like the best non-solution I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s the one I understand the most. Because where suicide is a small and easy full stop, the other option is something really long and complex and so impossible to understand from where I\u2019m standing that it starts to looks as if there\u2019s just no way it\u2019s possible. That it\u2019s basically beyond me. And this is where it gets really tricky, and this is the part that I need to say to myself. \n\nBut, before I do. I need to stress that this is not at all meant as a comment on anyone else here. Y\u2019all keep doing what you need to do to keep those chins right up high, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you aren\u2019t doing otherwise. Because I\u2019m certain everyone here is doing absolutely everything they know how to do to be and get better. So don\u2019t let this little rant of mine feel like another voice of criticism, this is really just a conversation between me and me, one that\u2019s been a long time coming. But anyway. Back to rant.\n\nFrom what I can see of myself, the real guilt and shame of it all is that there are definitely things I could be doing. Tricky, complex things sure, but still small and manageable things I can do every day that I\u2019m simply not doing. That what feels to me like barely managing to stay afloat is actually surrendering one inch at a time. That what I\u2019m really doing is buying into the depression paradox that I can\u2019t unfuck myself because I\u2019m already so fucked up that it\u2019s going to be impossible to even try to fix it. That I can\u2019t fix my own problems because I\u2019m going to fold when it gets tough. And then, when I do fold, I\u2019m going to cry and hate and blame myself for folding and then use the whole cry/hate/self-blame experience as fuel to beat myself up so bad that I can feel like justice has been served for giving up. That I\u2019ll punish myself on behalf of the depression so it can trick me into feeling justified to say \u201cStop! Please! I\u2019m already in so much pain, why are you making me do even one thing more.\u201d A sort of you-can\u2019t-hate-me-if-I-hate-myself-more strategy. And therefore I win. Or the depression wins I guess. It wins by having me prove to myself that I\u2019m useless and feckless and that clearly the whole thing is not my fault because when I try to fix myself, I end up being in so pain that I have to stop, and so clearly the whole thing is because of some inherent quality I\u2019ve got. That I\u2019m fundamentally weak. And therefore, that there\u2019s no point even trying.\n\nAnd this is where the truly evil part occurs, the real grotesque sharp-toothed evil-eyed element of this whole thing, because then I get to believe it. Because I want to believe it. Because then I get to vindicate myself. I am no longer pathetic, a wastrel, not doing enough to help myself and unable to do anything. Instead, I\u2019m damaged. Deformed in some way that\u2019s just too hard to pull apart. Which is bullshit because I know this is just what the shitty black tarred side of my brain wants me to believe. I know what it wants more than anything else is for me to buy so deeply into its power over me that I start believing it is me. That I start doing its job for it. And I\u2019m so fucking done with it. I am seriously **so** fucking done with it. Let me just say that again.\n\nI.\n\nAm.\n\nSo.\n\nFucking.\n\nDone.\n\nWith.\n\nIt.\n\nI\u2019m done with this pathetic vagrant type of life I\u2019ve been letting myself live, this habit of settling into something and then immediately looking for an exit strategy because I certain it\u2019s not gonna work. I\u2019m done with dipping a toe in and letting the depression convince me that it\u2019s too cold, or it\u2019s not the right colour of blue, or that it\u2019s just not the right time of the year to start trying to fucking fix myself. I\u2019m done with doing the depression\u2019s job for it. And so this is it. This is my promise to myself. I am going to make the depression fucking work for it. And if it wants to kill me, it\u2019s going to have to kill itself first trying to figure out how to do it. I am not its fucking slave. And here are some other things I\u2019m going to do.\n\nI\u2019m gonna keep going to therapy, even if some days it feels like it\u2019s not doing a fucking thing. I\u2019m gonna keep going. \n\nI\u2019m gonna stop letting the depression tell me that I\u2019m fundamentally damaged. It\u2019s not true. There are, for sure, a lot of things I need to work out, and I\u2019ll do it one step at a time, but I am not incapable of taking those steps.\n\nI\u2019m gonna stop beating myself up when I go for one of those steps and miss. I am not going to punish myself for missing. Not only is that not fair, or even realistic to believe as being possible, but it\u2019s just plain unhelpful in trying to get back up again.\n\nHere are some other things I\u2019m going to do.\n\nI\u2019m gonna mediate more. I\u2019m gonna exercise more. I\u2019m gonna attend to my thoughts more honestly. And, more than anything, I am going to learn how to live for the sake of fucking living and not for the sake of just surviving.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Rant over. I\u2019m going to put on some shoes and then go have a smoke outside and try to see if there are any stars out tonight. Then I\u2019m going to go to sleep and wake up and try as hard as I can to remember how I feel right now.",

But I am a dad and a person who deals w depression so maybe I have a perspective that might be helpful here. \n\nFirst and foremost I would challenge the internal dialogue that leads you to feel like a disappointment to anyone period! A lot of times depression can royally hijack our self perception, making us feel like the whole world thinks we are total screw ups sometimes even when that isn\u2019t the case! And this can become a vicious loop where we spin these messages around and around in our own brain until we start living beneath our own capabilities and potential bc self doubt and shame locks us down!  Is it possible this is happening to you right now? \n\nJust to ask a few q\u2019s- Is there anyone at all- A guidance counselor, teacher, friend, neighbor who you feel even remotely comfortable sharing even a small portion of these feelings with? Isolation can be the ultimate enemy for a depressed person... Like- I know it is so tough to reach out, but you reached out here... Is it possible to give yourself some major props for doing that?  A part of yourself had some really great insight and wisdom in reaching out like this... What if you tapped into that wise mind one more time somewhere not online? Even if you wrote it on paper and gave it to someone, if it is too hard to speak it out loud. I can\u2019t encourage you enough to give yourself that opportunity... \n\nI can\u2019t tell you the times in life I\u2019ve felt what you\u2019ve described! Totally lost and hopeless...But the only way out is to keep questioning that tape that\u2019s playing in your mind that tries to pull you down. You are worthy of love, respect and compassion. You belong in the space you\u2019re occupying here on this planet- You are here for a reason! (Even when that reason isn\u2019t clear.)\n\nI empathize and I know how much it can suck to deal w that inner hopelessness... But speaking as a dad, I know there is literally nothing my kids could ever say that would change the love I feel for them. Parents screw up a ton sometimes... And if you are in a emotionally abusive or dangerous environment, that is another story... But is there any way to just lay it all out there and let them know what you\u2019re going through? Especially if that might result in getting to try some medication that could temporarily help you get out of this current frame of mind? And if not through them... Is there any way at all to seek out some kind of mental health assistance? Any kind at all, just to get you over this period of depression?\n \nWhat if it changed the whole game for you just to get some basic meds or talk to someone who really knows what they\u2019re doing instead of random Reddit peeps like me? \n\nRooting for you and hoping things get a little lighter and easier to manage soon. Hoping you catch just a glimpse of how valuable and awesome you really are, and how much you really contribute to life just by being you. Sorry if this isn\u2019t super helpful...

You might be depressed. There are enough things in what you\u2019re saying that I think it\u2019s a possibility. But more than that, I\u2019d say there\u2019s enough in what you\u2019re saying to think that seeing a therapist might be really helpful. I\u2019m not saying that in a sarcastic way, I just mean, some of what you say reads like some pretty textbook issues, but again, it\u2019s just a paragraph online and I\u2019m just a guy with experience but not, you know, training. :) \n\nThink about trying to find a therapist you like. Think of it like trying a thing on for size. No one says you have to keep going, but just give it a try for a little while.",

But of course I haven\u2019t tried it yet so I\u2019m talking about it with little experience. But it just seems like these are petty issues that talking to a therapist would be a waste of time and money.",

It\u2019s not weakness to look for help, it\u2019s fucking brave.\n\nThere are lots of different schools of therapy. Talk therapy is what you\u2019re describing and it\u2019s helpful for some. There are others that are focused on helping you find coping skills for stuff, or dealing with trauma, or on just learning how to be mindful of things, and not holding onto shit that\u2019s dragging you down. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m telling you what to do.

                "i kinda relate to what you're saying as it happened to me years ago, and i can kind of recognize it as the beginning of my depression. if i were to describe depression from my experience, it's mostly just an empty void that sucks the life right out of you and leaves you like an empty husk, with occasional episodes of pain , bitterness and anger (mostly at night when i'm alone with my thoughts). \n\nmy advice is that you find a friend or two that you can kind of trust and try to develop your relationship further and get real with them. it takes courage and you'll probably be hurt a few times in doing so but that's the price to pay and i think it is worth it from my experience. and most importantly and i can't stress this enough.\n\nplease forget about how your problems might be petty . they are problems none the less and must be dealt with. every one has his demons and it's better to cut them before they get bigger. my advice is to approach the with humility and deal with them the best you can but with the will to solve it and \"transform\" in mind\n\ni understand the how you feel about the \" you're perfect how you are \" comments. they're terrible thing to say, completely idiotic and nihilistic. anyone can think of 20 things that they can change about themselves for the better if they consider the question seriously for even a second. saying that you're perfect already is like saying that you might aswell give up trying to better yourself since you'll never be better than this. so try not taking their compliments to heart.\n\nthe last thing i can say to you and i cannot stress this enough. be honest with others and with yourself. and make that an unbreakable rule. and face whatever comes your way voluntarily and don't shy away from things or hide, because people are much stronger than they think they are, and approach things with the good of yourself and those around you in mind.\n\nand if you wanna talk about things i won't mind if you send me a message. best of luck bud",

I don\u2019t do these things for pleasure, I do them because they expedite my suffering"

            "question": "Nearing 50 year old mom here.  I've been through the wringer more than once.  My whole family (except my son and one asshat brother and distant relatives who live far away and have never given a crap) is dead and I have no friends where I live except my boyfriend.  He's wonderful except he's even more depressed and socially anxious than I am, so I end up carrying the lion's share of the burden and end up with no where to go to get support for myself.  I've had a reputation for being the world's strongest woman, as things that should have killed me didn't, but I'm not; until now I've just been stubborn.  But I'm about over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLost my career almost 10 years ago trying to do the right thing, and my ex-husband managed to ensure I'd never work in that field again but utterly betraying me personally and professionally.  Ended up living in a friend's dining room with a toddler because we had no where else to go.  It's been five years since then and I've managed to get a job (no where near what I used to make, and still in debt because of all the unemployment), but for every step forward it seems like we're getting pushed at least three steps back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drive to work and all I can see it this every day; going to a place I don't hate but which makes me want to chew my own foot off, making barely enough to keep us going (not ever sure I'm making enough for that given the new crises), never see my kid or my boyfriend anymore.  Never go out, have zero friends and zero social life.  I work. I go home, I cook dinner, I go to sleep. I start over.  And for all of that not only do I never see my son, I can't even give him everything he needs on a material level, much less an emotional one.  So I wear myself out making sure he knows he's loved and gets attention from me in the few moments I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it doesn't sound like that big a deal given the other posts on here, but this is the culmination of a life that has always been a struggle at best, downright terrifying at worst.  The one time I was truly happy it turned out to be a lie (when I was with my ex-husband) and destroyed everything I'd worked for and built for myself out of nothing, and left me scraping by physically and emotionally to provide for our son (needless to say, his father doesn't care and is utterly absent).  I'm never going to get it back, I don't know what to do, I'm almost 50 ffs and I'm just so done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't do anything because my mother committed suicide and I don't want to do that to my son, but there are days I'm truly afraid I won't be able to resist anymore.  I pray I'll get hit in a car accident or get cancer or something that will kill me and it not be my fault just so I can die and he won't hate me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so exhausted pretending everything is okay and having to be the rock for everyone else, because no one else is strong enough to handle what needs to be done.  I know people will tell me to get professional help, but I don't have health insurance and we're teetering on the edge of poverty as it is.  I work/commute 60+ hours a week, and time off isn't an option for me.  I don't work, I don't get paid, we don't eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been diagnosed with C-PTSD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety and depression (I believe as a side effect of all of being terrified all the time, I don't think I would have depression were it not for all the anxiety issues).   Naturally not medicated because, again, no health insurance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have anyone to talk to so I guess I needed to vent somewhere.  If you read this far, thanks for that.  Peace.",

Maybe he won't right away but make sure without pressuring him that his feelings will be safe with you. Pay attention to every little detail he is telling you, don't interrupt him by pouring your own feelings out in my opinion that's what are alot of people are doing wrong when giving advice ( i sometimes make that mistake too but i catch myself and apologize for it ) Be really sincere with him as a person.  \n\n\nAfter he is done pouring his feelings out to you, than you can give him advice. You can TRY to let him know what helps you to overcome your anxiety and depression, but as i said before don't make it all about yourself.   \n\n\n  \nI think the most important thing here is to make im feel safe when he is revealing how he feels because then it's all natural you both start to tell each other how you really feel and that should be the base of strong trust.. Maybe that will help you and you can kinda get a feel on how to tap into giving him advice..  \n\n\nAnd that's all to get started.. try it and maybe you can tell us how it worked out..",

            "question": "So, I'm a 22 year old senior in college. To preface, I'm going to be seeing a therapist soon-ish about my issues, but I wanted the opinions of people who may have been in a similar place. Also, I'm really terrible with expressing myself because I write like I think, which is inconsequentially. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that I have depression and anxiety. But I tend to invalidate myself, I think, because I can be myself with my close friends. However, when I'm by myself, whether in a social setting or at home, I can't help but feel alone and unwanted.  Most days I stay in bed on my phone all day long. I want to succeed, but I can only find the strength to do the work to succeed in little infrequent energy spikes. For example, I can just barely accomplish one goal or task (such as doing well in one course) with all my energy one direction that might last at the very most 5 months, but that comes at the cost of dropping everything else in my life. I worry constantly about people liking me or saying/doing the right thing socially. When college started, I don't think I realized the depth of my issues and just tried to power through them by putting myself out there and trying new things. I have grown socially, but I'm nowhere near where I wanted to be in terms of career and whatnot. My GPA is *relatively* awful (2.2 currently, 3.7 in high school) because I just don't have the motivation to participate in all my courses and every semester it's the same ol' tale: Start off good, fall off the wagon, descend into inactivity (and anxiety about said inactivity), frantically try to *just* pass, repeat. I can't find an internship because of that and because my anxiety flares in job interviews, no matter what I try. Everything just seems so hopeless at this point. I honestly think that dying (but not suicide) or just getting in my car and escaping the life I've created would solve everything because then I wouldn't have any future to worry about. I feel like I'm a failure. Typing this now, I feel like I'm being melodramatic, but every time I \"pick myself up\", I fall back down harder and I'm at the point of not even trying anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little history: my single parent has had a very long history of bipolar depression and paranoia that has led to an unstable life, despite their efforts to provide me with one. They made sure I received a good primary and secondary education, but was not able to be there for more emotionally. My opinions were often ignored or dismissed. Since college started, my parent has been in and out of mental hospitals and incarceration, which put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders to keep our affairs in orders. (I had a slight (undiagnosed) eating disorder in high school. When I was in middle school, I played football, but I was so nervous before every practice that I would throw up every day. I'm also gay with body issues. My friends and people that know me think I'm loud and fun and clever, but that's because that's the image I sell to them and how I want to be perceived, I guess. I've never had a confidant. Barely even introspected and thought about my feelings up until I had to address it, which is now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anybody else felt this way? Am I being dramatic?

I\u2019ll learn from this for next time.\u201d \n\nYou have to move on from this.

You can\u2019t just keep the negative thoughts around and expect to feel good about yourself. \n\nBojack Horseman on Netflix does a great job of illustrating how people with depression behave and many things are the self loathing, and trying to be a better person and feel better. \n\nBut you have to recognize that the thoughts you have about yourself are lies.

You aren\u2019t. There is nothing wrong with you if you are able to get to therapy. Your mental health is more important then what other people think. It will also help you feel secure in yourself and not care what other people think.  If your parents want you to be around, they need to support your decision to try it.

It has been tremendously helpful. \n\nI thought about jumping in front of a train. Don\u2019t be like me and get help sooner rather than later. Good luck friend.

                "Never did I say there\u2019s nothing you can do about depression. Ever. I said there\u2019s nothing you can do about controlling your thoughts. You can\u2019t control what pops through your head. And yes I do feel like I\u2019m doomed forever. I feel like I\u2019ll never be happy. Stop gatekeepjng my depression and actually read my comments correctly",
                "I am not gatekeeping your depression. You can\u2019t control what pops in your head, but you can control what stays there- but you actively have to put the good thoughts there. You may not do this naturally, but it is possible. \n\nYou may need help with this, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nIf you are having trouble with this, I encourage you to see a therapist that specializes in cognitive behavior therapy, and teaches you healthy coping skills about the thoughts you may be having. \n\nI also encourage you to see a psychiatrist who can prescribe you medication. if one medication doesn\u2019t work in a while, try another one. When you find the right one, it will help you. The psychiatrist and the therapist may be the same person. \n\nPlease get some help. You are capable of being happy. You just don\u2019t see how yet. I will share with you what I shared with the OP. \n\nYou are enough. Many of our inadequate feelings come from not being enough. Marisa Peer changed my life with this video. The Biggest Disease affecting humanity. It\u2019s about 45 minutes long. It\u2019s available on YouTube. \n\nI know my words are probably moot at this point. But I think accepting that you\u2019re depressed and identifying that you have this problem is a good start- because it means you can seek treatment for it. \n\nIf you ever want to be happy, you need to seek out treatment of overcoming repetitive and negative thoughts. There are ways to do that. \n\nYou need to seek out help, you need to take care of your mental health. It\u2019s completely underrated right now but a very serious problem and like any illness you need to seek treatment for. It\u2019s not just you being moody. It\u2019s more than likely a chemical imbalance which you have no control over. I wish you the best of luck on your journey, and I am here to talk if you would like someone to help. Take care of yourself.",

                "How old are you? Are you in school? Perhaps if you could tell a guidance counselor your suicidal thoughts and they will set you up worth a psychologist more than likely. Suicide is a very real threat and if you tell a guidance counselor, they have to report it. if they don\u2019t, they are liable for any action that they don\u2019t take. Because you\u2019ll hurt yourself and they knew. That alone is a serious phrase. But they need to know how strong of a need you feel to do it. It should scare them, because it is very serious. \n\nYoung people really struggle with getting their parents to believe them When they say they are having depressive issues because their parents just think they\u2019re being moody teenagers. \n\nDo you think your parents love you? They may not, a lot of the depression can stem from overly narcissistic parents or ones who don\u2019t take care of their own mental health and are somehow afraid of mental health. They\u2019re the ones attaching a stigma to mental health care. Your parents may also just think you\u2019re a moody teenager and you\u2019ll get over it. \n\nIf you think they are doing that as a means of self preservation- you need to tell them that you are thinking a lot about killing yourself and you would like to look at some options with your family doctor to get help. If they love you, they will let you see a therapist/find medication etc because they don\u2019t want you dead. If they fight back, I recommend calling some local mental health organizations near you and ask them what options they can offer you. \n\nYou\u2019re not crazy just because you go to therapy or you need a counselor. In fact, most people I know who have been to therapy have had a positive experience with it. You are enough. I will try to help you as much as I can. \n\nGood luck. It does get better. It really does.",

More than likely, they will set you up with a psychiatrist and you will be in their network. I would also tell them that your parents refuse to get you help when you\u2019ve asked. \n\nTo me, that\u2019s a form of child neglect and a social worker should get involved. I would call a mental health organization and see what they can offer you as well. Any parent who refuses to get their child help when they\u2019ve expressed these desires is a disgrace to parenting. \n\nThis really upsets me when parents don\u2019t support their children through their mental health issues.

            "question": "I dont really know how to explain what I\u2019m feeling but its definitely worse than what I\u2019ve felt in the past. Any messed up situation i was in i was able to come back from. But this\u2026 when i wake up i honestly wish i hadn\u2019t. I don\u2019t look forward to days anymore. I just stay in my room and let time pass by. This time last year I was happy with the girl of my dreams, on the basketball team, making friends, my whole life ahead of me. That same girl left me and i don\u2019t know what to do with myself. Friends are moving on with their lives and im still stuck on a high school sweetheart. Countless people have told me to move on and other advice that honestly is true but i just can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Or more accurately I dont want to. I just wish things were like before.\n\n  \nI hate my life. Especially at this moment. I hate the person I am even more now then ever. Ik that\u2019s selfish and typical of someone who hasn\u2019t experienced real struggle but sorry it\u2019s just what I feel. In life everybody has their addiction. I am addicted to attachment and attention. And food lol. I need to be needed. I want to to be wanted. The world has to revolve around me and my wants and needs. I have a very passive personality. I\u2019m very self centered, narcissistic and selfish. Toxic traits that have been developed that I never even think twice about. Well that\u2019s lie I think about them all the time but never put in the effort to correct them. I\u2019m fat and lazy of course. Growing up without friends and being bullied in general broke me mentally and emotionally at a young age. In school, I oftentimes found myself isolated growing up. I don't say this lightly, either. I didn\u2019t have any true friends who wanted to see me outside of school. Going into middle school and high school, I had a few friends in passing, but very rarely formed any healthy relationships. Unfortunately, my isolation turned slowly to resentment and depression; my mind turned popularity into envy. I would always end up having to go out my way in order to get people to notice me. Like birthday parties for the whole class. Ever since pre K I would do that. I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends and even though that\u2019s a part of life, I see lots of my old friends still keep in contact with each other. I believe it was my social awkwardness that prevented me from reaching out. But that\u2019s how life goes people move on. I\u2019m just not able to. Being deprived of affection made me less than an introvert. It\u2019s made me mute. More so a weirdo. My low self esteem and lack of confidence doesn\u2019t help either. I have an abnormal amount of insecurities. I\u2019m too emotional. I thought for a time I could shut it off but really I\u2019ve been this way for as long as I can remember; overly dramatic.  \n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve thought about ending it. My family know I\u2019ve struggled with this for a while. Even when they thought it was gone it never went away. But what always saved me was my cowardliness, There were times i was confronted with the thought of losing one of my loved ones to suicide and I dismissed it completely. My mom and my sister are the two strongest people I know. No matter how many times I watched them cry they always picked themself back up and kept on. I wish I was a better brother and son to actually have been there to comfort them. Idk why I didn\u2019t. Idk why I resented my family for so long. I even one time imagined I had a brother. I think all the signs were there I was delusional living in a fantasy. I always blamed everyone else for my own problems.  \nMy family was great they provided everything I could ever ask for and where a great support system. They just couldn\u2019t understand me because I complicate everything. I always had a problem with accountability, and working hard for the right things. I think what also saved me where the times I actually got what I was looking for.  \n\n\nI kinda lied about my first. I actually lie a lot. There was this girl in middle school. Nobody had ever shown interest in liking me before and even though I didn\u2019t necessarily feel the same way I went with it cause I didn\u2019t want to be alone. I regret that decision every day. I would lie to this girl and tell her I love her. She was looking for actual love and someone who actually cared for her and that wasn\u2019t me. I broke it off after learning that her uncle who sexually abused her when she was younger just got out of jail. And after promising I would be there for her I wasn\u2019t. I chocked it up to me being young and naive but Ik what I was doing. I act really naive and innocent around people but really Ik everything I do. I manipulate and guilt trip so people will garner sympathy for me. Most of the time I don\u2019t deserve it. Ik that if there was a god that I would get punished for what I did to that girl. And I did.  \n\n\nHigh school years had to be the worst 4 years of my life. There would always be times where I had a good thing going but I would always fuck it up. Basketball, friendships, relationships, school. I always get in the way of my own happiness. It\u2019s like my mother would always tell me. I would dream about going back in time and fixing all my mistakes. But for a time I didn\u2019t have those thoughts. I still was doing bad in school but I finally had got what I longed for so bad.  \n\n\nThe first time I saw her Ik she was different. She had these cute glasses and button up shirt with jeans. Kinda looked like a dork. But I was so into my own head at that time that I didn\u2019t take the chance to build a relationship with her. She was always in the corner of my eye.  \n\n\nI stayed a virgin for so long not because I chose to. But because I didn\u2019t have it. The confidence to put myself out there. There was always something that brought me down whenever I would start to build it. When I made the basketball team freshman year I failed gym and other classes so I only played two games. I did bad and the coach told me I couldn\u2019t play next year because of a drawing I drew in global class. It was a just some joke but I really wasn\u2019t well liked because I just didn\u2019t work hard enough even though I had all the ability in the world. Also I didn\u2019t gel that well with the rest of the team or anyone for that matter because of my passive personality or you could just call me a pussy. Sophomore year I had nothing to look forward to. Nothing to drive me. I tried out still and didn\u2019t make it. That brought me down but I was at least social. I still went to my old middle school to play basketball with people Ik. But then came one of my other toxic traits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I grew up with more struggle so I could\u2019ve really understood how much hard work it takes to make a living. I lost a 700 dollar goose jacket because I hanged it up in a class and somebody stole it. My dad got me it for Christmas. They had just bought it and I lost it. But what sickens me is that I wasn\u2019t even that mad at the fact that I let my dad and mom down. I was more worried about the embarrassment in school. That\u2019s how much I cared about other people\u2019s opinion of me. I cared so much and it brought me depression for the rest of that year. Ik everybody knew and I couldn\u2019t find who did it. So I stopped being as social. This carried onto my junior year. Where I thought I had made true friends that year. Well here to say I don\u2019t talk to those people anymore. More so my fault. I betrayed my one friend by picking sides in his relationship with his ex and showed off my emotional clingy side. The others I think we just drifted apart. I made new friends senior year. Not really new but our relationship grew from freshman year. Those few people I can confidently say cared about me. I\u2019ve told them so many times how much I cherished their friendships. Ive been such a bad friend to them. I didn't deserve their friendships and I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m putting this burden on all of them.  \n\n\nAs for the girl. Well it pushed me over the edge and it\u2019s why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. More so I hate that now she going to tell her friends and family I was psycho stalker who couldn\u2019t get over her. It\u2019s tired to say I did it out of love. I don\u2019t t even know if it really was love or just she was my first attachment. I don\u2019t really want to talk about it in this but I\u2019m sure my friends and family can piece all together everything I\u2019ve told them and see how much I cared for this one person. Admittedly and begrudgingly I put this person over my own family. The things I\u2019ve done no one knows. She went to the army and for two months the only communication I got was letters. Every. Single. Day I cried myself to sleep. I missed her that much. Admittedly I was never my true self around her. I tried to keep that from her while we were together. But I let some of it out in my letters to her. And naturally she saw the overly emotional and dramatic side of me. Ik that would push her away. I just couldn\u2019t control myself. The day before her birthday I wanted to suprise her with a gift. My mom didn\u2019t want me out late cause I was doing bad in school after so many years of doing bad and not changing so she was fed up. But I begged her sobbing on the phone. Because being with that girl made me happy. It was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my life. To actually have someone care about me like that. But of course I wanted more. Gluttony my mother calls it. I wanted her to love me like I loved her. Even though she told in her own little ways that wasn\u2019t ever going to happen. But I kept forcing it. Then she broke up with me. I couldn\u2019t accept it. I took a flight across the country to get her back. I came back empty handed. I still couldn\u2019t accept it. I begged to see her during the break. I had my dad get me rental car so I could drive her wherever she needed or wanted to go without a license so I could have more time to spend with her and win her back. I kept remembering what she wrote to me saying we would spend the whole 2 weeks together. But I pushed her and she told me she hated me. Her sister texted me which was a sign that I was really pushing it. And I still couldn\u2019t accept it. She stopped hitting me up. I kept forcing it. I hated waking up feeling unwanted.I kept forcing it. She told me to leave her alone. She didn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore. I kept forcing it. Now look at me. My friends think I\u2019m crazy. She thinks ima psycho. Now they are going to tell there friends and family so if I somehow see them they gonna know me as the psycho guy who couldn\u2019t accept a break up. I guess they\u2019re right cause look what I\u2019m doing m. I was never really right in the head. And im alone. I fought so hard to be in her life. I don\u2019t want to live if I\u2019m going to be alone. I don\u2019t want to feel this anymore.  \n\n\nI\u2019m so ungrateful for life. I can\u2019t shake these feelings. I\u2019m just a disgusting ungrateful human being who never took the time to actually appreciate the blessings given to me. Just knowing that makes me want to not live anymore. I can\u2019t live with all these regrets. I can\u2019t change the past. I obsess about it. I don\u2019t want to anymore. I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I have no passion. Another reason why she left. I\u2019ve cost my parents so much money. I\u2019m going to school but don\u2019t have the passion to do good. I don\u2019t have any aspiration for what I\u2019m going to do with my life. I was going to become a cop or nurse because those are good jobs to have when you are with someone in the army. Look at me. I never planned on marrying this girl but I just didn\u2019t want to be alone so bad my whole life became about her. Every second became about her. Before I had nothing. Now I have nothing again. She probably threw away my pictures and letters. I poured my heart and soul into those letters. And the gifts I gotten her. I could never be a gangster l or someone that could make her laugh and connect to her like her battle buddies. I could never connect with her. I struggled and tried so hard. I put the most effort out of anything in my life. And I still failed  \n\n\nI don\u2019t want a funeral. I don\u2019t want people staring over my body as if they knew me. Nobody ever really knew the true me. I was never ever able to open up myself completely to anyone. Not even my own family. There is probably nothing on the other side for me but idc. Sometimes I want to keep going just in case I experience happiness again. Or if I get a family and a nice career and live happily ever after. But I\u2019m already miserable I don\u2019t want be a burden on anybody anymore or myself.",

            "question": "I don't know who to call, all of the crisis lines are for suicide. And while sometimes I feel like it wouldn't really matter to anyone if I died, or dying might be easier than life...I don't really want to die. \n\nI'm supposed to be so happy. I have a great job. A boyfriend. A nice home. Nice things. Yet....nobody cares about me. \n\nMy boyfriend has turned into someone who I feel like hates me. I woke up today and asked if he wanted me to make him a cup of coffee, and instead of saying yes- or no- he ended the sentence with 'You're always so indecisive'. When he left, he withheld saying \"I love you\", a more common occurence these says. I've cried first thing in the morning for 4 days in a row now. I feel like I'm not good enough. \n\nMy 'high-up' executive level job sucks. I am bullied, not invited to meetings by women who feel the need to compete. It's a fight to get people to return phone calls or emails. My boss rarely has my back, and he finally came through the other day and helped me out, only for him to retract it because someone who got caught not doing their part lied and said I lied about their poor performance. Instead of leaving for the evening at 5 to enjoy the sun, I stayed at the office and compiled a spreadsheet of each time this person blew me off or didn't show up to a meeting. Job protection, but lame. \n\nAfter work, I clean, cook, buy groceries, do everything for the house. I finally got tired of doing it all myself and tried to talk to my boyfriend about how unappreciated and uncared for I felt because he rarely pulls his weight. He got mad, and didn't do anything. I came home yesterday on my lunchbreak and he was laying in bed still. No chores done, nothing. I finally lost it and yelled at him and told him to get a new place or get up and help. He got up and helped and all evening I said thank you and showered him with compliments and praise. Then before bed, he picked a fight and we t to sleep on the couch. \n\nI still woke up today and tried again, and failed.\n\nMy mom abused me as a kid and was a complete jerk when I asked her for support after being date raped 2 years ago. She told me it was my fault for going to the bar alone and said I was welcome she came over to listen. I stopped talking to her. Since then, the rest of my family has stopped speaking to me. \n\nMy gram, the only one that had loved me no matter what, my entire life- died a year and a half ago. I miss her, so so much. \n\nMy friends' wives accused me of sleeping with their husbands last year- out of nowhere. Their husbands were close friends, and not my type at all. However, that caused my friends to stop being so friendly.\n\nI feel so alone. I have nobody to talk to. Nobody to hug. Nobody to tell me that its not all my fault.\n\nI'm starting to think that this is all my fault. How can I be so unhappy and alone if it wasn't something I'm doing?\n\nI don't know what to do. I just wish I wasn't so alone.",

I've also been in a state of lonliness for sometime ,I just keep hurting people around me thinking I'm correct.",
                "You may have nice things on paper, but without that human connection, I can see why you'd feel upset and alone. Aside from the bullying at work and the distance from your family and friends, it sounds like your boyfriend is also someone you can't fully confide in and reach out to for support. That's naturally going to make you feel lonely, taken for granted, and isolated. Aside from all of the above, is there anything else on your mind or getting you down at the moment?"

            "question": "This is hard for me to speak with real people about why I feel sad because I feel like a burden so I\u2019m going to strangers that I don\u2019t know. This is also kind of a rant cause I want to say how my depression developed. \n\nWhen I was a kid in kindergarten I was bullied and cried. This sadness usually went away after some rest and I could walk back up. Same thing in the first grade as well. But in the second grade I usually cried everyday for some reason. Wether it be bullying or I just needed to cry there was always tears streaming. The worst part is that I would want to tell my parents but my dad needed to work early in the morning and came back when I was asleep. My mom before would be busy with my brother and soon second brother. Being the oldest is hard on me without the aid of attention I was alone. I couldn\u2019t describe this feeling cause I was only a kid but when I woke up I\u2019d be sleeping in tears. The bullying wouldn\u2019t stop even after telling teachers and the attempt to tell my parents. To make thing worse when I was verbally insulted my parents would tell me to suck it up. Not that aggressively but to the point where it didn\u2019t help me. \n\nThird to fifth grade I was now annoying, trying to get attention from people around me. But annoying others can\u2019t help get the right attention that I needed. So I turned to crying and this is the point where I learned to \u201cman up\u201d. I tried to stop crying and stopped after the fifth grade as I was then going to middle school. Manning up doesn\u2019t help cause now I can\u2019t express how I feel. \n\nSadly, my personality kept with me from annoying to a mix of annoying my friends that I no longer see and introverted. Now I can\u2019t get help due to me being annoying and if you he proper people do see cry I become introverted and shy away from the problem. Same thing in the seventh grade as well. \n\nThe eighth grade was confusing as I switched schools a few times and never could find friends that I could tell this to. Every time I cried I made an excuse due to manning up I learned. Every time someone asks me if I\u2019m okay I always say yes from the introverted nature. And every time I want to tell my parents my dad still has the same work and my mom now tells me to just die every time I disagree.\n\nNow three and a half years later I\u2019m going to be a senior in high school. I want to be atheist but my mom is a hard driven catholic. My dad still doesn\u2019t see me and now he\u2019s forgotten my age and birthday. Every time I want to speak to my mom she always gives me a lecture instead of help. I have Asian parents so the stress levels increase tenfold because our family is also poor. I\u2019ve had three breakouts where I\u2019ve stored all this depression. One each year of high school. And during those times I feel like a burden to everyone I know my parents could do without me as I\u2019m a waste of money. My friends don\u2019t need an annoying friend that makes everybody hurt more. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to relive this pent up stress but doing sports which solved my physical problems. But emotionally I\u2019m still a wreck. After I get rid of the burdens phase I go into a phase that makes me feel as if I\u2019m the problem. I didn\u2019t study hard enough. I didn\u2019t clean the dishes. I didn\u2019t do the kick right. I didn\u2019t help them out. It\u2019s my fault for not being there. It\u2019s my fault for not being smart enough. It\u2019s my problem so I should just kill myself. \n\nOf course, I\u2019m too scared to actually follow through but I do put myself though physical pain. Not cuttings but standing in cold temperatures trying to get sick. Punching myself because I\u2019m not strong. These pains will never be seen because I\u2019m too scared of the blood. \n\nIn the end I still need help going into senior year. I always put up a fake smile to let others know I\u2019m okay since I don\u2019t talk to many people and my friend aren\u2019t good friends to talk about for depression. So without my friends or family I\u2019ll turn to stranger because I won\u2019t know you and that helps me rant for freely knowing that a stranger wouldn\u2019t leave me behind. \n\nI\u2019m not going to commit suicide cause I\u2019m too scared of dying. But I\u2019m not afraid of \u201caccidentally\u201d getting kicked to the face. I\u2019ve always wondered how it could be better without me and I feel lots more would be happy. I just needed to rant because I\u2019m scared that if my depression keeps getting pent up I won\u2019t be scared to just die on the spot. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant and thanks for trying to support me.",

                "First, know that hurting yourself never makes things better. It only creates more problems. So that is not a solution. Ok? Next, chances are that your mom 'lectures' because she wants you to be happy and grow up well, and learn about life. But moms often have a lot going on and mess up in that area. Maybe give her another chance, maybe ask her to just listen and hear what's on your mind? Does she know you were treated this way in school? That is a hard thing to deal with. Congratulations to you for getting through all those hard years. \n\nWe all fake smile sometimes, that's ok. Sometimes we even fake it till we make it, and the smile becomes legit. And you might find answers through your moms church, even if you don't want to be part of her faith right now. Maybe there's a youth group or high school classes you could try getting involved in. Or, as someone else said, just get out of your own head. Make a point to help someone else  a little every day, take the pressure off yourself, be the change in someone else's world even in a very small way. It does help! \n\nAnd remember, you are here for a reason. The hard times will come along but they can make you a stronger, wiser, and better person. Maybe a change in perspective is all that you need right now. Life is not always easy, but that's ok. The struggles can be your tool, not your burden. Hoping you learn to truly love your life. It is a gift, and so are you. May each day bring a new ray of light for you."

            "question": " I'm reposting this post because I want to share my experience with  depression and help you understand how I managed a couple of months ago  to get through it. I've been depressed since I was 15, lasting about 6  years until I finally came to understand what it is. I had no will to  live, contemplated suicide and had no purpose in life or whatsoever and  the truth is you don't need really need one. Basically to explain I need  you to understand what thinking and feeling is. Feeling something is  reacting to external action through thoughts that make us feel and  react. The way we do that is natural but if you control your reaction  then you control what you think and then you control what you feel. What  you feel is your choice. It is and will always be and if you say you  can't then that's that's your ego not allowing you to do so (important  to note that I don't talk about physical feel) . It's really hard, I  know, I'm already talking about things that are hard to visualize but  please allow yourself to understand that everything you feel can be  controlled through thinking. If you choose to be sad you will be sad, if  you choose to be happy you will be happy, your mental state is a  choice, What. You. Believe. In. Is. A. Choice. ( important to note that  not everything we believe is also true) I believed I was depressed,  because of it I allowed it to eat me from within for years basically  disabling myself from feeling other emotions but I believe it was a good  thing for myself because it built me. Believing things can be  dangerous, it directly affects your body and brain and modifies you,  this is how worse it can get. It can get so bad that no matter how much  help you get from outside it will be useless so the deeper you get the  harder to get out. I don't advise you to take small steps doing small  things or anything like that. I advise you to choose to stop believing  you are depressed  because it will keep being real if you keep believing  in it. The mind is the most powerful thing because we have a  consciousness and the worst thing about it is the ego. We will  ultimately die and return to the ground and your consciousness will  cease to exist and so you will live this short life the way you choose  to. So i'm asking you, WHAT DO YOU  CHOOSE?",

                "So you believed you were depressed for longer than you actually were, therefore if we just choose to be happy our brains will suddenly work fine again?\n\nSorry mate, not how it works. I'm glad you've recovered, but this is bullshit. I outright *refused* to believe I was depressed for a solid year and a half. Did it cure me? Did that make it easier?\n\nNo, it drove me to suicide.\n\nWhat HAS helped me personally is medication. It hasn't cured it, but it helps a lot. \n\nDifferent things help different people, but for people who are genuinely depressed it won't go away by just \"\"choosing to be happy\"\".\n\nSo, in response to \n\n&gt;WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?\n\nI choose to believe scientific fact, which says \"you don't choose to be depressed and you can't choose to make it go away\". I choose to believe the multiple medical professionals who said \"yeah, you have depression.\""

            "question": "I\u2019ve struggled with depression since I was 14 and after I was molested by a family member. I tried to commit suicide shortly after but was found by my older sister.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as it is now that I\u2019m an adult.\n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy for a little over 1 year. I\u2019ve been going through a lot with work and a very long relationship ending due to his continuous lying/cheating.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled a lot with passive suicidal ideations with no intent. As of the past 2-3 months it\u2019s been ideations with intent. When I was visiting my parents, I tried to get into my moms gun case. Had I been able to find my razor last Saturday, I would have hurt myself. I've been super open and honest with my therapist. After Tuesday\u2019s session, she is worried for me. She wants me to look into checking myself into an inpatient treatment program.\n\nI can\u2019t get in to see a psychiatrist until the end of July, but I am scared to wait that long. I\u2019ve gotten rid of everything in my house that I could hurt myself with.\n\nSo I looked into it and I really think I need it, but I am very scared to take this leap. I\u2019ve got all of the support in the world from my family, my sister will take me to the place and make sure I\u2019m okay, make sure everything is fine with my apartment, and offered to take care of my dogs at her house. I\u2019ve been isolating myself since Tuesday, not really answering the phone for anyone and my therapist has texted me every day asking how I am, while getting basically no response from me (which I feel insanely guilty about).\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking for the push I need, or just to vent, or something.

                "I'd say you shouldn't be thinking if it's a leap, or a big step forward/backward. If you feel this is what's going to help you, you should do it. Your family is on your side. If you really feel unsafe, and you moved all things that you could use to harm yourself, then do it. \n\nI don't want to sound forceful or something. I would've gone on therapy and would've visited the psychiatrist a long time ago, I just can't afford it, and from where I'm from, they just tell you to take some happy pills, mmmm, cuz 99% of em still live in the stone age and believe that depression can be cured by some electro shocks.\n\nBut, if you think you can go on without therapy, without taking a break from RL for a while, then I'd suggest doing that. Maybe, starting a hobby? Something small? To me at least, small things like collecting cards, feathers, writing stupid stories I talk to kids in park when they run and see me, that helps me, it makes me feel a little bit more then just a grain of sand in the endless desert.\n\nI don't know ultimately, all I can do is support you either way, and to tell you not to off yourself because of this or that is a stupid thing to say. Just, stay strong. And don't give up."

I used to really think about suicide like everyday, but now not even once a week maybe even once a month. I dont think about it often, probably only did recently because of stuff going on in my personal life. But I am doing a lot better now. I'm over something that really broke me down and I feel all the better for it. I did think about something today though, I was thinking about how hard it was to get to where I m today, the military and like two people in my life really helped me not even make an attempt, though it was mainly cause I wouldn't be allowed in the military with scars. But my friend, and my mother. Without them both I may not be here at all. It was a little scary all of the things that had to happen in my life to be here today. I wish. Could thank them both more. I wish I could really show them both how much they mean to me. It's crazy. But yeah I'm doing a lot better now in fact some days I'm really truly happy. And I actually have dreams now, I used to not have any. Because of some really bad stuff in my childhood, I developed PTSD and severe depression, I used to get beat for crying so I for a number of years I couldn't cry, eventually and gradually I started getting better, still have the PTSD but I'm a lot better, new people are hard, and it's hard to trust people but... I'm happy and I've got more emotions than happy and angry. I'm just thankful I guess, and thanks to those of you guys who were there when I wanted to rant and get any type of positive feedback. Or just an answer so thanks. It's still really hard but. I'm happy. Oh right the dreams thing, one, I used to not have dreams I think it was my brain making sure i wasn't having any nightmares because of all the stress so it just blocked them out, Maybe i dont really know. But now I have dreams, and they are so fucking wild I had absolutely no idea like I had heard about people having weird dreams but I will have some weird dreams. And it's so obvious it's a dream yet i don't know that until i wake up. I had a dream about giving somebody a hug which was weird because I woke up still trying to give someone a hug. There is still this weird thing... I dont know why but whenever I lay down I cry. Not like sobbing or anything just a tear or two rolls down my face I could be laughing or reading a book and I just happens. Anyways thanks for reading!",

I started isolating myself more than before and I'm  still doing it to this day. If I am alone I'll always think about myself  and how I am not who I was nor what I wanna be. Often I am crying in  the night. Some people saying that I started being awkwardly silent  suddenly and that I seem kinda depressed (their words, I don't really  like to call myself it). I opened myself and talked about my problems  and got told that I should just see a doctor and that it would be much  better. I declined that offer saying it will be better/easier and that I  can deal with it alone. For a month it was actually fine and my  mentality was better til 1-2 weeks ago. I was starting to think about my  \"problems\" and that I just can't face them\n\nMy laziness. I am struggling to commit to anything that could be useful  for me or my future. I rather sit around thinking about what I have to  do or I'm just going to sleep in the evening. I cannot focus on anything  and \"fall back\" (dunno how to say it) and sink into my thoughts. E.g in  class if I'm getting told something I prob forget it in a minute or didn't even listening the first place. I cannot speak fluent. I am  speaking while not even proceeding what i am thinking and what i am  about to say which makes me stutter. I am missing many words that I  normally use. I am not the kid i once was and it hurts. I was always  smiling and having fun. Every time I am thinking about this a quote from my father gets into my head belong the lines of \"There is a difference  between you and other kids because  you are always smiling at it makes  my day every time\". Nowadays everyone tells me that I should smile more  and I always get asked whats wrong with me/my life cuz I always look  sad. I am about to do my A-levels after summer break and I know I can do  it so easily but for what? It feels like I have to be something big,  maybe something that I don't have to be. Why cant i just be a average  person? Why do these thoughts haunt me every night? I have a easy life.\n\nAround  3 months ago we were doing a trip with 4 school classes in which my  mental just boomed. I held myself in a background as best as I could.

I thought i was not alone in the room and that something wants  to kill me in there. Til this day i never had such an experience again.\n\nAll  these things hit me all the time. I always tell myself that suicide is  so stupid but the fact that i have to tell myself that just hurts.\n\nI am feeling off and tired of living but not wanting to die.

            "question": "I'm worried about an online friend of mine, who's been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts since before I knew them. I know as a friend - and a friend trapped on the other side of the world at that - all I can really do is support them. But recently I've been feeling completely at a loss as to how to do that. I've been trying my best to listen to them when they're down, to let them know they can message me if something's troubling them, and to actively ask how they're doing. I've been trying just to be with them as a friend too - gaming, chatting, sending them memes, etc. \n\nThe real problem is, they obviously need more help than a well-meaning but somewhat clueless online friend can offer - and I'm not sure how to (or even if I should) encourage them to seek it. I'm also not quite sure what resources are actually accessible to them, given their circumstances.\n\nTheir family is screwed up and abusive. My friend is frightened to reveal the true extent of their depression to them, as past attempts have been met with anger, accusations, and threats of having them institutionalised if they attempt suicide again. Their family is unsupportive, abusive, and a major source of stress in my friends life, but as their problems make them struggle to find employment (and their family forbids them from looking into any welfare they may be entitled to), they're stuck living with them for the time being. Their problems also mean they currently only have online friends, none IRL. \n\nI know they've tried therapy in the past, but have had their faith in it shattered after experiences with bad therapists - including ones that no-showed for appointments, and one that breached patient confidentiality. Additionally, whilst they've tried it in the past, they fear they won't be able to afford therapy at the moment - as well as having a fear of being involuntarily committed to an institution if they reveal their suicidal thoughts. I've tentatively suggested online therapy to them, as a possible option if face-to-face therapy is out of the question, and they've said it's something to think on. \n\nFrankly, I'm terrified. I'm absolutely shit-scared that my friend is suffering like this, and that I'm going to lose them. I've had nightmares about finding the body of someone I've never met in the flesh. I don't let on how scared I am to them because, well...it isn't about me, and I don't want to add guilt onto everything else they're going through. But I do want to do everything I reasonably can to help and be supportive - whether that's gently urging to get help, or just holding my tongue and listening when they need me.\n\n**TL;DR: Online friend is depressed and suicidal. They need help, but I don't know what to suggest, or even if I should suggest at all.**",

            "question": "So I (21f) have been struggling with depression since I was 8 years old. Or at least, that's when I was diagnosed with clinical depression.   \n\n\nI've gone through a LOT including (but not limited to) bullying, sexual assault, domestic abuse, a miscarriage, and the suicide of my baby sister.   \n\n\nSometime last year, I took some recreational drugs and my symptoms of my depression completely disappeared. I genuinely knew what it was like to feel happy again, without having to take meds or go to a therapist. That only lasted about a year.  \n\n\nNow I'm at a point where it seems like nothing is ever going to go the way I need or want it. I feel like I'm constantly struggling every day in every area of my life. I have no one who listens to me or my feelings. I have no support. And I currently can't afford therapy.   \n\n\nI never truly envisioned myself making it to my 20s. I always thought I would have killed myself or would have been dead by now. But here I am. And now, when I try to think of my future, I don't see anything other than struggling and pain. I'm not sure how much more I can take.   \n\n\nIts also hard for me to reach out to people about how I feel because I've always been the strong one. I've been the one that EVERYONE leans on. I'm constantly looking out for others and helping them through their problems because it genuinely makes me feel good. But when I try to tell people how bad things are for me right now, they don't take it as seriously because \"well you've been through so much, you can get through this.\" But I'm tired of 'going through so much' I'm tired of being the strong one. I'm tired of having to bite my tongue on how I feel about things so I don't upset others.  \n\n\nPeople keep telling me it'll get better. But there literally hasn't been a single year that I didn't have something major happen to me. I'm just wondering when things will ever get better? Is there a point in continuing when I can't see a viable future ahead of me? Will I always be this depressed?",

I feel like I don't matter even though I am being told that I do. I want to believe it inside but my depression is clouding my judgement and making me incapable of seeing my own value. I want to matter very bad, but I keep feeling like I'm meant to kill myself or that it is only a matter of time before I do kill myself. I wish I didn't think or feel such thoughts.

In my own experience, it will take time, like 3, 4 months after you've found the right medication. When starts to appear that really small will to do something, go for it, for more painful that will be, in the end you will feel better, go for a walk, play your favorite video game, talk to a friend, watch a movie, do what you want to do, and day after day things will get better. Now, the most important phase it's have a reason to live, by that i mean that you need to create a goal to be reached, something that makes you want to get out the bed to make you closest to it, maybe the job of your dreams, maybe a girlfriend, maybe being one of the best players of some game, that's something that you will need to find in you, a life without goals it's a life without meaning. Maybe a religion will give you a meaning, and will help a lot, but will not give a goal, and that's the most important thing at all.\n\nI'm a nihilist, so dealing with my depression sometimes it's almost impossible, nothing has a intrinsic meaning for me, but the goals that i have and the desire to see them happening keeps me alive, and i hope that keeps you too, talk to someone regularly, go for a treatment and serch for goals that you really want to achieve.",

Right now, I'm sitting in an empty bathroom, because I need to be alone. These moments of strong suicidal thoughts can come at any moment at all. I remember once sitting at home, and thinking how it was the perfect moment to end it.\n\nMy relationship is very shaky with my entire family, and I've gone through so much, sometimes it just bubbles over and kills me. My significant other probably doesn't care about me as much as I care about them. My grades are fine, my parents don't think there is anything wrong, but my sister is the only one who knows my struggle. \n\nI used to escape from these moments by self harming severally, and I've been doing this since I was 10. Outside I genuinely seem like such a fun person, but there's no one I can be raw with. I'm not even open with myself, if that makes sense. This is just a vent. I'm not gonna commit suicide anytime soon, because my family wouldn't be able to handle it... \n\nSo stranger who stumbled onto this post, I hope you're doing well, and you shouldn't do anything rash if you know you're leaving people behind who care.

Being dead is kind of the perfect solution for avoiding my emotions and what ever mental illness\u2019 I have.   I just think if I stay rude with people again, everyone will leave me alone again. This time for good.   I am gonna move to a foreign country and if I don\u2019t feel better without my family there (after a month or so) then I\u2019ll do it.  I\u2019ll kill myself (I\u2019ll commit suicide). I just wanted to say this to someone, anyone (who wouldn\u2019t look/say that I am crazy).   I don\u2019t know what went wrong in my life, tbh anyone would have had a very comfortable and good life if they had my life. My family has had enough money for everything (until 2 years ago) but then again my dad never says no to me for anything (and yeah I probably am a bad person for  asking so much when I know that I\u2019ll just commit suicide in a few months or a year or two).  My body is kind of shutting down (again) slowly. I have lost my appetite already. I can feel the pain in my body, it\u2019s there, pressing everything down. And when I say my body is shutting down, I mean my depression is taking control of my body again. With depression comes my anxiety and anorexia as a bonus!   I am starting to ignore everyone again. I am being to rude anyone and everyone around me. I am going back to being the bad me, the defeated me.",

You're an adult, you need neither their permission nor their approval to do so. There are services, often free, available to help you feel better. If nothing else, please know that the suicide hotline has a webchat so you don't even have to worry about being overheard on the phone. Depression has nothing to do with being you being grateful, they just don't want to accept that the things you've experienced have had such an impact. It's scary to think about so it gets swept under the rug like oh stop with the hormones you're fine. Sometimes it's not hormones and your not fine. It's okay to feel that way and it's never an insult to your family if you need help, it's insensitive of them to suggest that. Maybe they're just not great at empathy and don't know what to say. I'm sorry you feel alone and like no one is taking you seriously right now, if you want to talk privately we can. I hope things sort themselves out before too much longer.",

I don't know if this would help you but me and my brothers do this, We talk to ourselves, like we just go to a silent room or where we feel comfty and just talk to ourselves like if we were someone else (\"so today my friend made me feel bad\" \"well, what did she do were you in the wrong or was she?\" And you just talk to yourself like someone else ) \nIf you can, try getting a job and secretly getting an online therapist but if you can't find a hobby or just something that you enjoy (I for years didn't enjoy anything so don't force yourself) there are also apps where normal people help but sometimes they just don't have that how can I say it?

I started antidepressants, but the truth is I would just like to die. They helped in that my mood is ok, but the situation I'm in is the same. Just imagining nooses, hammers hitting me, and falling. I didn't understand the phrase sweet release of death until recently. I've never attempted suicide before. I'm turning 29, have been in relationships, graduated from college, have a couple of friends, and a family that cares about me. I got injured on the last job I worked, I have bad legs. During my undergrad I would get so stressed from studying that I'd cry in the shower, dryheave when going to study my chemistry book, and have panic attacks.

The last 5 years have been hell and I don't know how to get out of it. The situation with my wife is in limbo due to infidelity on my part. We are basically staying together because we can't financially raise the kids alone. So we live in the same house more like house mates than spouses.\n\nI have been staying at home for the last 1.5 years to watch the kids because we can't afford child care. I have been only able to work part-time only when she comes home from work and this has added to my depression. I have been clinically diagnosed and have been committed because of a suicide attempt about 3 years ago. I'm trying to turn my life around now. I just got into a coding bootcamp and will be starting next month full time for 9 months. There is a lot riding on this because if I get through it, I can provide some financial stability for my kids then I can currently. This will be a full time commitment in addition to part time work at night. From my past experience, I know that stress and other factors that cause stress will send me into a deep depression. To remedy this I have implemented the recommendations that Jordan Peterson gives about making a schedule, having a routine, and watching my diet so that it helps my mood regulation. But I suspect that I might need the help of anti-depressant medication to stay on course for this one. I have resisted medication in the past because I always associated the need for medication as a sign of weakness and also I didn't want any of the side effects of taking them. But history has shown me that this might be foolish because I haven't been able to deal with life so far without them. \n\nThe problem I have now is that I don't have insurance and I can't afford to go to a psychologist.

            "question": "This is probably gonna be all over the place. I haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional because I'm too terrified to tell my parents, but all the hallmark symptoms are there. General sadness, loss of interest, unmotivated, always tired, self-loathing, urges to self-harm, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 16, homeschooled (somehow managed to get incredibly behind, which adds to the depression), and I have no friends irl. I have online friends, and I trust them with just about anything. I've been half-tempted to give my address to one of them incase I end up doing something uh...rash, if you know what I mean. But anyways, they're good friends at heart, but a majority of them are absolutely AWFUL at helping. I don't blame them. This isn't something you can just slap a band-aid over. Most of the time they'd end up arguing, going something like:\n\n  \n\"tim needs this\"  \n\"no, he needs this instead\"\n\n\"that wont help\"  \n\"you don't know that\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eventually just...shut down for a few weeks. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't interact with anyone, I was offline on multiple places. This caused my friends to get worried, and a few of them started some discord intervention group chat thing. I only know about it because one of my friends there actually understood what I meant, what I was talking about, etc. So he joined just to tell me what was going on. It ended up being an argument between two of my friends over what way to best help me. Despite the fact I told them about 40 times that I just wanna be listened to. Now, this was MONTHS ago, but it still frustrates me somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I should tell my parents, I know I should get up and do something, I know it doesn't magically get better, but this immense amount of fear and anxiety prevents me from doing so. It doesn't help that my family constantly makes half-serious remarks such as: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Tim you're no fun\", \"Tim, stop being boring\", \"Tim just hates fun\", etc. But they wonder why I don't wanna be around them. Its frustrating. Every time I try to do something, it seems to do absolutely nothing, or I just end up failing. I've tried getting out more, spending less time on my PC, etc. but at this point the only thing that could maybe help is a therapist, and I'm too terrified to say anything. At this point, theres only three things keeping me from jumping off a nearby bridge:   \n\n\n1. Christianity. Say what you want, I don't care, but its one of the few things keeping me alive.\n\n2. My friends. \n\n3. Causing my family the same pain I have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts infuriating knowing what I should do but being too scared to do it. My step-dad yells even when he doesn't mean to, he starts arguments over almost nothing, he can be sensitive, he's the biggest hypocrite I know, but at his core, he's a good person. My mom is too over-protective, she gets too worried and too panicky over everything. Before they let me move my PC to my room, any time I laughed anything, my mom would ask \"what are you laughing at\", \"what are you playing\", etc. Shes paranoid. And I don't like the idea of telling her about depression because of it. My step-dad is more relaxed when it comes to issues like this, but I'm afraid he'll just tell my mom, and I can't trust my siblings either. They'd all go to my parents despite what I say. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.   \n\n\nMy brain is always foggy, I can never think straight. I feel like I locked myself in my own brain. I don't like being edgy or depressing all the time but I can't help it anymore. My friends get worried if I make too many depression or suicide jokes. I'm getting sick and tired of waking up to self hatred, tiredness, and general sadness. I'm frustrated. I've been like this a full year already and I see that number increasing unless I either kill myself or actually get help. It doesn't matter how well my day goes or how bad it goes, I still hate myself and end up almost breaking down at the end of the day regardless. I'm just lucky I don't think I'm ugly I guess.

I listened to music. I contemplated, a lot. I dreamt of a future- even when I was in the darkness I could dream of a place that I could be me. \n\nI did have friends and I wasn\u2019t homeschooled.

Its irritating and frustrating, yes, but its not entirely their fault.",

You're not alone.\n\nIn my case...\nMy mom is very harsh on me when she gets mad, she said something like: \"No wonder nobody likes you when you're like this\". Even though she doesn't know or shouldn't know the fact that I have no friends ATM due to my severe social anxiety and stuttering.\n\nI don't know if this makes you feel less \"lonely\" in this situation, but I just wrote this in case it helped. Nobody deserves to be treated this way. I am sorry for you, I'm sorry you're feeling this way, but you should try to go see a therapist. It helps a lot, just imagine how much easier life becomes when you get treated for your mentall illness(es). Especially depression you won't be as lazy for example that would probably relieve so much stress if you feel pressured to do something.\n\nThe last thing I wanna say is that: suicide/self-harm is never the way out. What I try to think about when life gets really sad is that if I took my own life, I wouldn't be able to enjoy a nice summer day or enjoy the smell of plans for example.\n\nAnyway as I said earlier, I hope this helped :) Stay strong \u2764\ufe0f",

I remember I never did my work, although I somehow was absolutely fine when I went back to school. The best solution to the homeschooling stuff was going to school, but because of ADD depression gor worse, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019d be a problem for you. Starting school that late is scary, I know, but it turned my world around \u2014 at the very least, tell your parents. It\u2019s REALLY scary to do so, but once it\u2019s done it\u2019s like tearing off a bandaid. Bad at first, but fine once you\u2019re done.

Parents can be very difficult to deal with because they feel like you aren\u2019t respecting them when you disagree with them, but by having a conversation with them like this, you are actually showing them more respect then by lying to them. Of course it is up to you what to do because you know about your own situation than me, but I think it\u2019s always good to be open and honest with the people you care about.",

You\u2019re a person just like them, someone who people care about, and if you care about someone, you worry when they are going through something that you don\u2019t understand, but people get less worried when they know what\u2019s going on or have at least a little bit of an understanding, rather then just being left in the dark.",

It was incredibly freeing to be independent.\nAlthough it didn\u2019t cure my depression, it helped so much.

Like you, I was scared and her attitude (single parent) enabled me. By 24 I was in terrible shape. I had moved back into my mom's, was agoraphobic for a year, hadn't worn short sleeves for a decade due to self Mutilation. I did a lot of drugs, more than anyone else because I wanted it all to end. I guess after me not leaving the house and my mom learning the reason I was wearing long sleeves in the summer was SI, she asked to see. I hesitantly and in tears showed her. It was really bad. That was over 10 years ago and everyone still notices it pretty much right after meeting me. So I didn't even realize the extent that I was hurting myself.  Anyway the next day I saw my first psychiatrist. I think it might have been too late. I had a few good years, and some cool things happened. But I am now considered treatment resistant and have a list of things I could attribute to depression, but I'm already creating a wall of text here. \n\nThe point is, whether you need meds or CBT, or something else, waiting is only going to allow the negative thought patterns to become stronger. There may even be neurobiological effects. \n\nGaining the courage to do something isn't a passive thing. Did you feel better/ different/ more clarified after this post? \n\nOne tool I use the most is writing. It is a way to see my ideas from a different perspective. I would recommend making a plan. It doesn't have to be a deadline plan, it can be tentative. But everyday write what you're thinking, feeling, at least once a day. Include the reasons why you haven't sought help. Not a list, but justify them, like you were a lawyer or something. I am nervous because of the following reasons: list them all. Try it, like daily. The best possible outcome is that you eventually just take the plunge and ask for help. If nothing else you will have a thorough list of symptoms for when you finally do reach out. Btw I will start a lot of entries by writing this is dumb ten times or just random words, song lyrics, whatever. \n\nAlso. My mom was bipolar so I do not say this harshly or as if it is easy. But you need to make sure you get help regardless of what harm you think it will cause your family. Honestly, she may be inspired by you and look into her, I think you said paranoia. My mom was sometimes paralyzed with that so I can relate. \n\nThis is a very good start though, I hope you realize that.",

                "People aren't the products of their actions solely, just as you wanted to 'win her heart', she turned her back on you in her time of need. Neither of you did this purely because you wanted to. You couldn't handle the rejection, and it was a hard time during your life.  Crushes are usually positive; regardless of the outcome they strive for us to be a better version of ourselves. It was great that you were able to confess, and great of her to turn you down kindly. But just like how you struggled with rejection, she struggled with the thought of you attempting suicide.  \n  \nIt's clear she's a great person, and she was upset by the fact you nearly died. She could of felt like she failed and had to externalise that failure by blaming you. She would care if you died, and it's likely that caring for you is what made her say such things.

                "Hi there,\n\nIt\u2019s likely you\u2019re suffering from severe high-functioning mental depression, and the fact that you have requested help even anonymously is a huge step.\n\nWe all have a story that we likely feel is unimportant and would be selfish to share, but the fact that you have gone to such great lengths to hide the truth from your friends and classmates is proof that this isn\u2019t for attention; you care about others. As you likely don\u2019t want to open up about this publicly, I\u2019ll offer some tips to help deal with both the physical and social side of your depression.\n\nYour depression meds will help with the lack of serotonin but your surroundings and physical state can boost both your social and mental health, as it did for me. Constantly try to distract yourself if you\u2019re numb with anything emotional, such as music or films. Try to ensure your surroundings are pleasant for you; try to keep a somewhat tidy room and keep warm; And if you feel like you\u2019re wasting your time, try to wake up earlier if you can. That feeling of success can propel you further.\n\nAs for the social side, you have a choice: Hide it or open up. As the latter is a harder path, hiding it will be the easier choice. I have a stepdad too, one who\u2019s treated me like an enemy and a threat and tried to alienate me from my family. Luckily for me, that family is both large and trusts me more, and while I can\u2019t be sure if you have the same situation, distancing yourself from your abusers is a good option. Try to find close friends who can truly trust to keep your secret, and they can defend you during a panic attack. Try to not adopt your weaknesses socially, but defend and downplay them. \n\nGood luck, talk to me some more of you need more help",

At the time of the heart attack I was working in law enforcement which I think contributed to me having this along with poor eating habits. \n I was in the hospital for the better part of a month and many of you know being in a hospital that long can lead you to having some pretty bizarre thoughts so I think that was the start of my first bout with depression. Never having dealt with it I didn't recognize or understand  what I was going through so I never got help with it, but I knew something wasn't right. Moving along to June 2015 as I mentioned I suffered a stroke which paralyzed me from my upper thighs down and I had no feeling at all and was wheelchair bound and most of the time bed ridden and it really took a major toll on me and my life. After being told 3 times that I'd never walk again and really not being able to do anything for myself, it put me in a very dark place and that's where I  started recognizing what I felt in 2009 but on a different level. I was hearing things, I was seeing things and having vivid dreams about death and I  was the killing myself each time. I also felt physical pain, inside I was so afraid but didn't wanna tell anyone about what I was going through so I put up a fake smile and pretended to be happy when I really was dying on the inside. What brought everything to the point where I wanted to end everything was one day I was home alone my son was at school and I was very thirsty so I rolled over to the fridge to get water but it was all the way to the back of the fridge. Keep in mind at the time I was in a very small wheelchair because I couldn't afford one for my size, and when I reached to get the jug the chair tilted forward and I almost was thrown out of it. Filled with anger and disgust feeling like I was burden to everyone I rolled the chair to my room and I was crying I couldn't see straight my head was fogged up I went to my closet and grabbed my AR15 and rolled back to the kitchen table put 2 shells in the clip, put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. To my surprise the gun didn't fire so now I'm really crying and pained I pulled the trigger again and the gun didn't shot again something it's never done before. I felt so low because I  said I can't even do this right, took the gun threw it on the floor and went to get all my pills I knew that would work as I'm coming down the hallway something said look up and when I did I saw a picture of both my kids and I  screamed so loud crying thinking about what I almost did, still holding my box of pills. I almost took myself from my babies!! Not even 20 minutes after all this happened my mom walked in my house and I grabbed her crying I've never hugged and held onto my mom so hard in my life.

Depression is a growing issue in teens and many feel unable to even survive economically once they leave school, so seeing someone who was successful and still had depression should be a clear reminder that anyone can suffer from it.\n\nIt was a miracle that gun didn\u2019t fire and I\u2019m glad you were able to open up. It\u2019s an inspiring story for many to see how you survived losing so much but realising what you still had.\n\nThank you",

I can\u2019t imagine the despair you felt in that moment. \u2018\u2018Twas truly a miracle that the gun didn\u2019t fire &amp; your mom came in when she did. You are still here for a reason.

            "question": "I need help.\n\n17 year old male, 18 beginning of July. \n\nI've been struggling with my mental health for all of my life, and it got worse after starting puberty. \n\nI've always been terrible with social groups and interactions. Never managed to make a lot of friends, and those I did never sticked. Had some of your regular trauma from parents and older brother. \n\nI've always felt alone.\n\nWhen I became a teenager I started with the depression. Got very bad episodes, where I would shut down, and fake illness so I could stay home. I missed one month of school once, and on a trip to Italy for school I faked illness for two weeks so I could stay in bed, and could only think about jumping off a bridge.\n\nAs I got deeper into adolescence not only did my mental health deteriorate, but my ability too. My memory became poor, and my focus was gone, always having mental fog. I couldn't remember words, and speak eloquently. Math ability went to the shitter, always making stupid mistakes that would then seem retarded later. \n\nMy IQ seemed to have dropped as much as 10 points, since I have periodically been applied tests and only perform worse. \n\nStarting high school made me much more suicidal because of this, and the isolation of not knowing anyone, and the people I did know wouldn't even look me in the eyes. \n\nI had already gone to a psychologist, and after that a neurologist, and recently a therapist.\n\nGot medication, and have been on it since 2017. The doctor has changed my meds more times than I can count, and none of them have helped. She told me that I would probably never be off of meds, but they still don't help me. I have no cure.\n\nI feel I have been slowly getting worse, going down my own dark little hole. \n\nI've always been obsessive, but now it feels like it's all I am. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything makes me irritated, or break down. Noise seemed to be the problem. Voices make me go mad, but even when I'm alone and in silence I keep thinking about everything needing to shut up. The chatter is all inside my head, and it never stops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like sometimes I am already dead on the inside, and I'm not really human. Just a shell o what I wanted to be. \n\nI started going out to party's and things, mostly just filling myself with alcohol, or I'll just drive around going as fast as I can. Hoping I'll be something else, hoping I'll feel.\n\nI've had one relationship with a girl, that eventually ended. I loved her but after that I couldn't feel anything for anyone (and no, not even her). I just ended up obsessing over her, even if I didn't feel a thing. Really tried after I started to get over her, and even tried with another girl, but even with all that I managed to bosses with her as well, and got called a creep and that I harassed her. The meds make me worse off. My sex drive is completely dead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of high school I have made some friends, but I end up isolating myself, and losing them.\n\nI'm starting college in August, and I'll move to another city for that, but I fear that will only isolate me, and make me worse. I think that if I don't kill myself soon, I'll do it then. I see no real future past a certain point. \n\nI fear it'll all colapse, and I'll truly break down. I fear I'll lose interest in my career, since it has already happened. I was going to study astrophysics, but after an episode I saw nothing in that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going crazy, always suffering. Everyday is pain, and I just want it to end. I am sick. \n\nI contemplate suicide everyday, but what ultimately stops me is just the possibility of a failed attempt, and getting scarred for many years to come, and always under watchful eyes after the attempt. \n\nThe hurdle of death is my prison.",

You have people who love you. \n\nThese are lies that your inner bully tells you. \nYou are enough. \n\nWhat medications have you tried? \n\nHaving been on medication helped me tremendously. I think you need to fake it till you make it. You need to go out and meet people. Dont be afraid to do that. Also, do things that make you happy. Do you draw, write, sing, dance, make art? \n\nAdding something productive will hopefully make you feel more accomplished. I think you need to keep working with the medication.",

Those I called friends don't reply to my texts, or simply tell me they don't want to go out or that they're always busy yet I see them on social media in some club. \n\nThose who do know about my mental health have gotten to the point where they resent me. They've taken care of me for so long, and it is very taxing, I know. I can't expect for them to not grow and live because of my own lack of capacity to do that very thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been on many antidepressants, and anxiety meds. I don't remember all of them, but I can recall: Prozac, Strattera, Quetiapine, Sertraline, Vyvanse, Fluvoxamine, and others I can't remember. \n\nThey don't work, or just work for a bit and then I'm back to my shitty life. Even worse, some make me just feel drugged, or like I'm someone else. \n\nI was supposed to be on meds for a max of 8 months, and I'm going strong onto 2 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try and fake I'm happy, but that just makes me worse.

Isolating yourself will not make you better. \n\nYour friends are probably frustrated with you for 2 reasons. \n\nThey have tried to talk some sense into you and you just continue to go on about how you are not loved. It\u2019s really annoying, either put up or shut up. They are trying to help but you keep refusing to do anything about it. \n\nThere comes a point where your negativity impacts other people and you are difficult to be around. \n\n\nThe second reason your friends are letting you go is because it is really hard to help you if you don\u2019t want to be helped. \n\n\nWhy do you think you have a shitty life?  Do you have faith? My faith has helped me tremendously with my depression. \n\nThis simple phrase if you can get it though your skull is You ARE ENOUGH. Let me share this link with you. Marisa Peer changed my life with this talk. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lw3NyUMLh7Y \n\nDepression kills people because the voices in their heads tell them that they are a loser, never enough, worthless. Celebrities struggle with it; People who seem to have it all, fame, fortune, public adoration, prestige- and it was never enough for them. The voices in your head can be really vicious. \n\nYou have to find the will in your mind to keep going. It does get better but your lack of belief that it will is a hindrance. \n\nFind a hobby, a craft, etc. you cannot walk around having a pity party for yourself and refusing to do anything about it. \n\nDepression is hard. But you cannot give up and suicide is giving up. Don\u2019t give up on something so valuable and important. Your life is valuable and important. \n\nI repeat. You are special. You are loved.

I'm not really sure how I would go about getting an appointment. I haven't had an appointment since I was 10. How would I get an appointment? \n2. Since I'm a minor do I need to do this through my parents because I'm not sure I want to tell them until I'm sure I've got depression. Would the diagnosis need to be shared with them due to my age? I don't know.\n3. I understand there is patient confidentiality but my GP is a family friend. As a result it would be extremely awkward  telling them about all my feelings and emotions. How do i look them in the eye and tell them I've considered suicide?\n\nBasically what would your guys advice be. Should I just see my GP and if so how? Are there other ways of getting diagnosed in the UK? I live in the Brighton area and was wondering if there is some sort of walk in clinic I can go to, avoiding the GP.\n\nAny and all advise would be seriously appreciated.",

                "I was your age when I was diagnosed. I was embarrassed to tell my parents so I wrote a letter about it instead and handed it to my mom. After she read it, she scheduled an appointment with a doctor, who then referred me to a psychiatrist. I was put on anti depressants after meeting with the psychiatrist who confirmed my feelings and diagnosed me. \n\n\nYou should tell your parents as they have the resources to help you since you are a minor. Also, it's nothing to be ashamed about - many people have depression or feel down and your parents want what's best for you and for you to be happy. I suggest if you are worried about the family friend GP to ask your parents to schedule an appointment with a different GP.",

They will most likely at first assess your physical state(diet, exercise etc - these can often bring people to conclusions of depression. A poor diet and lack of exercise can mimic certain aspects of depression surprisingly well so don\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s what they will ask) at the root cause before moving towards advising about the psychological aspects of depression. \n\nFirst thing you need to do is start a dialogue with the GP and then follow the steps they recommend, if you do this and things don\u2019t change then the facts are in and you can begin to move down the correct path for getting well. \n\nIt can be disheartening at first when you just want to feel better but following their advice is key.

The risk of someone with depression committing suicide is greatly increased if they do not get treatment. That's why debunking the myths surrounding depression can help people who are suffering to feel more comfortable talking about their feelings and emotions and seeking treatment much sooner.

I tried to sign up, but my mom wanted to know everything before she went any further. I couldn't get to my counselor because her and I were busy. \n\nMy mom also said that she doesn't think any thing is wrong with me. I am a very outward happy person. I can show emotions and I look normal outwardly. Good grades and aspiring to enter IB program. The part I left out was my constant feeling of suicide. It gets annoying since it comes in a constant wave. Like I might be normal for a while, normal meaning feeling here, but I will get a heavy sense of dread and anxiety. Like I had been over to a friend's house when this happened. I was just picking up a cup when my mind started racing. Lots of this stems from childhood trauma and just over the years of things escalating. I slightly repressed these thoughts, but they aren't really gone, just subconscious.\n\nI want to ensure a life line for my self. Someone who knows much more than me, so I can finally receive help.

However thats only when the thoughts of suicide started. I have felt useless all my life. I got bullied in school. My parents always just said: \u201ejust a couple more years of school.\u201c\nI never had any real friends. My parents are not bad, if I wasn\u2019t myself I bet they would be great parents, but they always try to \u201ehelp\u201c and they have this \u201ejust pull through it\u201c mentality. And they made everything worse with that. I am at the point where I think that my parents are just viewing me as a failed useless person. And they try to \u201efix\u201c me by saying how much they are hurt that they have to see me just lying in bed all day. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds I have nothing to live for. I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.\nI am in therapy but I don\u2018t think that it works. The only reason why I am still alive is because of Youtube and Onlinegames. I just have no one to talk to. And therapy doesn\u2018t work as it schould because I had psychology in School and I always know what the Therapist is trying to do. I am at the Ponit where I question myself why I should even bother to continue living. Im probably going to die alone, so why not just end it now. And I know people always tell you: \u201eJust go out and find friends, go out and find a Girlfriend, just show interest in something, somewhere someone likes you.\u201c It doesn\u2018t help I have no motivation to do anything. I don\u2018t know what to do anymore. That aside IF I manage to talk to someone I always get labled as \u201eweirdo\u201c and then this person doesn\u2018t want to have anything to do with me. On the Dating side of things (if there even is one, since I have given up a long time ago) I always get shot down. I guess I\u2018m just ugly or my personality is shit. Propably both.\nAnd worst of all If I manage to talk about this I get told: \u201eyou aren\u2018t depressed, you don\u2018t look like your depressed\u201c. I have like a \u201ehappy mask\u201c that I wear to get through the day at work or school. A way to distract myself.

I don\u2019t recall if I was prior, but I had a revelation 8 years ago that me thinking of killing myself because of student loans and generally constantly being down was not a good thing. I have/had friends who I\u2019ve known since high school, and a boyfriend, and only my boyfriend seems to have noticed how bad it gets because he\u2019s the one I talk to when everything gets to be too much and the world is too scary to continue living in.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m losing friends.\n\nA couple months back, some friends were making plans to play magic and I couldn\u2019t find a ride til after I knew they had started. I finally found a ride and we got to the game store to find they had left to avoid a player none of us particularly like. I decided to go to the other place we like to play and message them to find out where they went. They said they went to the local pizza place and said when they were done eating they would head my way. 3 hours pass before they finally arrive and I had texted the group sporadically to see what was up but wasn\u2019t getting responses. I got a little snippy. They tried to say that there were no concrete plans, which there were, and acted like I was at fault.\n\nNot long after that I tried to make it easier for everyone to communicate about playing my making a group chat, which apparently warranted one of them blocking me completely because I forgot he hates them and he said it was blowing up his phone (it wasn\u2019t\u2014I was monitoring it closely to make sure).  \n\nSome of my friends don\u2019t text me as much or invite me to things because I\u2019m a picky eater and they want to go to different food places. I honestly try my hardest to make sure that if they want to go to dinner somewhere I won\u2019t eat anything, that I eat first, or I\u2019ll just order a soda. My family has already been hard enough on me for being picky, and it hurts I\u2019m being excluded by my friends as well.\n\nAnd most recently, I blew up at a friend\u2019s girlfriend. She and I have been passive aggressive towards each other for the past few months. I have been trying to like her, but the age gap in her relationship with my friend coupled with her immaturity has meant that we\u2019ve been attacking each other without actually attacking. I was playing magic with her boyfriend while she chatted with someone, and someone was thinking of doing something that would have put me out of the game by getting rid of all my lands. We play casually, and he could see I was starting to be a little upset. A couple of the other players were kinda egging him on while I was attempting to convince him not to do it, when gf decides to chime in with \u201cDon\u2019t let her bully you.\u201d I told her to fuck off, and she said \u201cAll your friends are ditching you\u201d to really drive it in, and I told her no one in her department at work liked her. Which I knew was wrong to say the instant I said it, but it felt nice to hit her back with something nasty.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s never going to talk to me again and that I\u2019m losing more friends. I keep thinking about just killing myself but it really seems like a stupid idea and at this point I don\u2019t think any of them will care. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter if I tell them I\u2019m depressed, and someone said if you tell your doctor or therapist you\u2019ve been considering suicide that they put you in a ward and I can\u2019t afford to miss any work.\n\nSo the whole situation seems pointless and it feels like I\u2019m going to wind up alone because no one but my boyfriend can see how much I\u2019m struggling. I feel like he\u2019s eventually going to get tired of it and leave me for someone who isn\u2019t fucked up in the head.\n\nI need to know how to quit being a bitch and driving people away.

If you don't want to tell a therapist that you're struggling with suicidal thoughts, then consider telling a therapist that your struggling with feeling down all the time and pushing friends aways.\n\nIt's hard to seek out therapy when you're feeling bad, but it can be helpful in resolving the things that are causing you pain.

I realized that I feel lonely in my hometown and kept dwelling on the interaction that night, ultimately costing me sleep. Suddenly out of nowhere I thought about suicide. Not personally, but as a topic it came into my head, which somehow seems disturbing to me. It's been happening more and more. I know that I'm not personally suicidal, but I'm like scared of it now. In middle school, when I was really depressed, I told my parents I was considering suicide and the conversation was appropriately dark and serious, but that was 6 years ago and they are certainly well over it. However, the fact that I told them that has really really been invading my brain the past few days. They're out of town so I'm alone at home this week, and I think I'll get over it as soon as we can have a heart to heart about how much better I am now.

I was a bit direct, please don't feel attacked or ashamed or anything. It was just what wemnt though my mind at that moment. So I wrote this:  \n\n\n  \n \n\nYou are damn right, you can't leave your kids. I am gonna be honest with you. I have two friends who have lost a parent to suicide when they were kids or in their teens. They are 30 and 34 years old now and guess what, they are both not well. I know that at least one of them struggles from bad depression themselfes. The other one tends to have really bad relationships. And that is YEARS after the death of their parent.  \nAnother friend of mine has a mom who has tried to kill herself several times. One time I was there (we were 15 and 16 back then), we found here in her bedroom, totally drugged up with a suicide note lying on the desk. My friend broke down and cried. I have never seen someone cry that intensively and desperately. We (me and her boyfriend back then) literally couldn't make her get up while we called an ambulance. She curled down on the floor, just crying. In the suicide note it said something like \"my daughter doesn't need me anyway.\" The mother made it through but it was a traumatizing experience for all of us.\n\nSo yeah. You will affect your kids if you do anything to hurt yourself. Badly. They love you, they need you. You are the one who is forming their personality right now. You are the one who is influencing what their life will be like. No matter how much you tell yourself you don't matter, you do. You really do. And not only for your children.\n\nAnd I am sure you can do it. For your kids AND for yourself. There is so much you can and will be experience with your children. Wonderful times, also difficult times, yes, but your kids will come out great if you try your best to get better.\n\nI wish you all the best. I believe in your strength.",

                "I haven\u2019t lost my dad, but he was and is severely depressed. He\u2019s shared a lot of wise words with me over the years but one of his most important lessons in my life was that even if you think that things would be better without you, they probably aren\u2019t. Depression doesn\u2019t go away the instance you talk with a professional like it\u2019s represented in media. It\u2019s a long ever lasting battle that hits hard brick walls almost every two steps but every time you break through one a small weight gets lifted from your shoulders. \n\nPeople grief over people they might have only shared tiny unimportant bits of their life with, and the death of a parent, especially one you remember fondly, is a pretty strong gut punch. If your son is loving, that means you\u2019re doing something right. Sure a kid might always crave a parents attention, but laughing and enjoying their time ( even when it\u2019s just for a short time) when they get to be around them is a different thing entirely. \n\nIf you really want to die, and I don\u2019t mean that as in you want to feel happy but really that you want to die, then do. The death of a parent is usually a rather big deal for a child, but he will usually learn to deal with it and go on living. But really I think your son will lead a much happier life with you in it and that you are a far better parent and person than you might realise, because bad folk don\u2019t care about others feelings. Even if you think your unhappiness is in the way of his own, I can assure you that it isn\u2019t. Like I said my dad is fighting with the same thing as you and I and he\u2019s even described a very similar thing and he\u2019s by far the best thing in my life. \n\nI hope I don\u2019t seem aggressive or like I am trying to shame you, because I really aren\u2019t.

Ask for resources with the intention of helping you cope with your depression for your son. I'm sure no one would turn you away. You can also ask for social workers in your area (not with child and family services). But licensed clinical social workers sometimes use a community outreach approach and will have knowledge about accessing resources to fit your needs. I hope this insight helps. It seems like you want a better life for your child. So remember that includes taking care of his parents so they can provide the best love and guidance for him. I think once you have some help it'll make you a stronger parent (having lived with this horrendous depression but still making an effort for your son).",

Nobody went into work on September 11th 2001 thinking that there was anything that could cause them to jump from the windows of The World Trade Centers, but when faced with the hell that manifested that day in their offices many had just 2 choices, either burn to death with the screams of their coworkers being the last thing they heard while suffocating and burning to death or jump from the window into the relatively clean air towards the city they loved and getting that much closer to the ones they loved before they died a quick and painless death.\n\nThe point is, at that moment their circumstances had caused or their mind had convinced them that their was no other option. In that moment they thought that they were doing what was best for them and for the ones they loved.

            "question": "It has now been 7 years since I've met a treasure who became really special to me. We became very close and decided to become a relationship. Unfortunately, she had to return to her home far away from where I lived, so we started mailing each other. Every day, I would anxiously check the mail to see if I received a letter from her. Those letters gave me so much energy and love that it wouldn't have mattered if I was told that my life was going to end - I would be the happiest man alive.   \n\n\nIn the distanced relationship, there was a lot of pain for the both of us. The pain of not being able to share our presence, the pain of not being able to introduce each other to our friends without a picture, and the pain of not being able to hear our untouched voices were like a dagger resting in your chest unattended - and there was nothing I could do. I eventually received a phone call from her saying that we needed to end the relationship. This wasn't something that either of us wanted, but we knew that if we continued, we would be living in pain for a very long time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite of this decision, it didn't take us long to start writing to each other again. For years, we would continue writing, in which things began to feel the way that they were - including the pain. Because of this, I prevented myself from being available to any other woman because I was convinced that we would be together again. To be honest, I believe that she felt the same way. However, somewhere along the way, I believe she decided to sever that idea when she stopped talking to me.  \n\n\nLife eventually took for the worst. I was anticipating my first day of college, in which I received a phone call saying that one of my most cherished friends had committed suicide. This his me very hard for me, and triggered a hurricane of depression. I stopped developing myself and started erasing myself. I prevented myself from interacting with people and eliminated myself from all positions that I had become a part of. I even stopped writing to her. For an entire year, I was just a lonely piece of flesh that would stay in my room with the lights off while barely eating. Eventually, the consideration of killing myself became acceptable. I am no-longer who I was.   \n\n\nToday, I still fight against depression and suicidal thoughts. I am in love with the memory of a girl that I once knew, and I continue to wait for that letter to show up in my mail box. Not too long ago, I finally took action to end this. I tried another semester of college, but that became a complete pile of stress. During that time, I met a very pretty (and even popular) girl in my school department who I once knew a very long time ago. Since I saw her almost every day, I quickly learned a lot about her life and her story. It took me a while, but I eventually gathered the courage to ask her for a date. You can imagine how revolutionary that was for me after years of shunning my availability. She informed me that she just got out of a bad relationship and she needed time. Very closely afterward, she was walking around in the arms of another guy in our same school department. I saw them every week day, together, loving each other, in which I would grow jealous and have a civil war with myself, while drowning in self doubt and yearning for the relationship that I once had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I am ever going to do this again. Nor will I know what other opportunities that will come my way. I feel guilt for asking that young woman to a date. I also feel guilt for erasing myself. I feel sadness that the one person who I really want to be with is just a sweet memory that I can no-longer reach. I want her to tell her how I feel but I don't want to haunt her with the person that I have become. Plus, I want her to live her life free from myself - but I want to see her again, so badly that it hurts. I've waited so long, still allowing that dagger to sit in my chest. A part of me wants it all to end, another part of me wants to forget about who I was and live my life on my own, building a new me while severing everything that I've worked so hard to become. However, \"Just let go\" doesn't work. I will hold her forever because she was the most heavenly gift that I was given.  \n\n\nI know that I'm not a happy person, but I don't know what to do except to wait for time to take me, just like how I've been waiting to see her.",

I would rather be depressed and suicidal than hollow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night it came to me that everything I am doing is simply not working for myself. College is hurting me as I don't have any true friends and the stress from my major and classes is bad to the point where I can feel my mental and physical health deteriorating. I would change major, but I am half way done with college and I really don't want to be in debt and put stress on my family since they are helping pay for my college.

            "question": "Hello guys, this is my first time writing in reddit. So i hope you guys will be kind to me. I just wanna share how i got my depression with all of you and how it haunts my life everyday. So, my dad left my mom to married a woman he met and start a new family 8 years ago. But during their married life my mom constantly got beaten by my dad because my dad was a hot-headed person. I spent my childhood watching my mom got beaten by my dad constantly and as a kid i didn't knew what to do and it has left me traumatised until now. Oh, and he also chased my mom away from our house. \n\nMy mom decided to moved into my grandparents house. Several years later after they got divorced, my grandparents(on my mother's side) both fell sick where my grandpa suffer from Alzheimer's and my grandma suffer from anxiety disorder. So, i had to help my mom to take care of my grandparents. And to be honest i did not complained not one bit because i appreciate of when they both helped me and my mom during our tough times. \n\nSkip forward, i had to attend foundation study after finishing my highschool years and i was worried because there wont be anyone to help my mom to take care of my grandparents. I spent most of my nights sleepless thinking about my mom. Most people would think that hiring a maid or person to help would be the solution. Well, that was only temporary because most them were not willing anymore to take care of them. So that left my mom alone, without me. \n\nTaking care of my grandparents really took a toll of my mom as she now suffers from sclerosis and she could barely walk to go to the bathroom every night. I was very upset about it. My mom is the kind of woman who always smiles infront of me and always happy-go-lucky. But watching her in agony pain it really makes me feel useless just like when i watched her got beaten by my dad. So, i decided to take action and called her other siblings to inform about my mom's condition and i told them to take care of them temporarily while my mom will be receiving treatment . None of them wanted to take responsibility of taking care of my grandparents. They all came with excuses of being busy. But each year i can see they updated their social medias that they were enjoying holiday overseas.  \n\nSo during my university's break, i drived my grandparents to one of my uncle's house and left my grandparents there without informing him in the first place. He was very furious about it. My mom and i moved to other town so they couldnt found us anymore. I did this so that no one can intrude my mom for the time being so that she can received her treatment for her sclerosis. But that left us with bad perspective from people when my uncle told all the people who knew my mom and me that she had thrown her parents away. Now, people who used to know me and my mom hated us but they really did not know the real stories. I blamed myself for what was happening.\n\nThat left my self esteem to be really low. I wasn't once the person i used to be. I felt like my life is falling apart. Until now i don't have too many friends because i feel like someday they will also hates me just like other people did. My social life keeps getting worst just like my grades. I hated my life so much that i think about commiting suicide each day. I couldn't sleep at night for the past years because of it. I did take some medication but that only helped for a while. I felt like no one can understand me for what i have done.I'm sorry if i went too far.i just wanna share with all of you my story.",

But if you\u2019ve made it this far, then I really need some help. \n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: my family is fucking nuts. I was born to an insane, drug-abusing, alcohol-obsessive, chain-smoking dad and a mom who cares more about her friends than she does about me. My grandparents are extreme Christians who believe it\u2019s a sin to live with someone to whom you aren\u2019t married. Now, for the big twist: I\u2019m gay, and my whole family hates gay people.\n\nSo, for most of my life, I\u2019ve repressed my gayness. I never really got into dating, but nobody ever attributed that to me being gay. However, two weeks ago, I came out to my secret crush and we\u2019ve been dating ever since (in secret). I really did think he loved me like I loved him.\n\nThen today happened.\n\nI asked if he wanted to come over to my place and watch a movie or something, and then, over a text message, he broke up with me. He checked every single box of a stock break-up (\u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019d be better off as friends,\u201d and so on), and made it evident that we\u2019d never get back together. His excuse was that he was unsure how his sexuality meshed with his Christian beliefs, though he clearly just didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with me.\n\nDespite the fact that I\u2019d never said anything even derogatory about him, despite the fact that we\u2019d known each other for over a year, despite the fact that I supported him unconditionally with no regard for my own mental health, \u201cwe\u2019d be better off as friends.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never known love until two weeks ago. I\u2019d done everything I could to accommodate him, to make him happy, because I felt that I had to. Seeing him happy was one of few things that brought me joy. And now, we\u2019re \u201cfriends.\u201d \n\nThe crushing pain of this situation is killing me already. It\u2019s been three hours since it happened, and since then, I\u2019ve trashed a room, destroyed valuables, and entertained the prospect of suicide. In a fit of lucidity, I\u2019m writing this, hoping that someone can talk me down, but already my insanity is creeping back. Who would care if I died? My family sure as hell wouldn\u2019t, as soon as they saw my texts with my ex. My ex might pretend to care, but he\u2019d just go on about his life anyways. My \u201cfriends\u201d couldn\u2019t care less. And before anyone on Reddit pretends to give a shit, Reddit is part of what drove me here. You don\u2019t know my fucking name, you don\u2019t know what I look like. Then again, what the fuck does anything even matter?

(Everything has blended together because I don't care about anything anymore)\nMy aunt and uncle who I loved very much and never got to spend a ton of time with were in an awful car accident. My uncle survived but is paralyzed. My aunt however, became a vegetable for around 2 or 3 months and I only got to see her once before she died. The image of her laying in the bed with her arms curled up making no noise at all with her mouth hanging open was just too much for me and I broke. I thought of and almost attempted suicide that night. Ever since then I've been battling suicidal thoughts, depressing feelings, and just feeling worthless and not caring about anything except video games and wanting to sleep. I've tried telling my dad about my anxiety from this whole situation and he laughed at me the first time. I tried to tell him again today and he told me that I was being disrespectful because there were people out there with anxiety that makes them throw up over simple things and that I have nothing on them and to just listen to him and realize that me having anxiety isn't real. That hit me hard. I went to go play volleyball with some friends and it just got worse from there. Some random people joined our game and just talked bad about me and made fun of me the whole time and I almost broke down crying one time. Not fun. So now I'm at home about to go to bed wondering if I should commit suicide. Somebody please help me, I'm stuck and can't get out. I'm being choked around the neck and every time I try and escape the grip gets tighter and I can't do it anymore. I need a way out or I won't be living much longer. Please help me.",

I've been thinking about suicide a lot for the past wee while and what it would mean for the world around me, although I don't actually want to die as it scares the living fuck out of me.

There is a whole world out there to explore, so many things you could find a passion for. There may even be a way back into the military if that's what you're ultimately set on. So many paths to your goals, but you don't know what'll happen unless you explore.\n\nDon't ever think nobody cares, talking to someone irl just like you did with this post can be the difference and make you want to heal and want to get better because you are definitely worth it.",

I'm sure you can find people who have similar interests as you. I wish I was able to put myself out there, but sadly I can't. Do it for people like me who don't have that kind of privilege.

You're really young and I know you've heard the phrase \"you have your whole life ahead of you\" and there's a reason that's coined a phrase,its because it's TRUE. I'm 40 yrs old and I still isolate myself and dont associate with people for periods of time. It's sad to say but that kind of behavior is common for people with any disorder. Occupy yourself some way somehow, this will pass I promise you. The light at the end of your tunnel is still there,sometimes you have to force yourself to see it. I promise things get better. Suicide isn't worth it,half the time it doesnt work and you just end up in a psychiatric unit somewhere under 24 hr suicide watch while someone watches you even in the bathroom and believe me that's very embarrassing!!

I [19F] have had depression for about seven years now, but I hid it from everyone until it got so bad a few of my friends became so concerned by how I was acting that the reached out to my parents in August 2017. My family is amazing and incredibly supportive and I started therapy right away then meds a few months later. This was during my senior year of high school, and nothing was improving and things only felt worse now that I had a diagnosis and everyone (parents and the few friends who talked to them) knew and I just wanted to die. I attempted suicide in January 2018, and although it was really my first try, it was the first one that was planned and really executed. I was hospitalized for a few weeks and then was in a PHP program, and none of it seemed to help. My problem was basically this: if I had the choice between magically snapping my fingers and my depression being gone and cured and me being happy and normal or me just being dead, I\u2019d rather just be dead. No one could understand why I didn\u2019t want a happy life and neither did I. I just wanted to be dead and nothing could give me the motivation to work for a change when I didn\u2019t care for one. I was just so sick of everyone being so worried and concerned and I hated seeing the people I care about in pain when I knew no one could help me, so I started lying and faking it again. The meds gave me a little more energy so I was able to lie my way out of therapy and just pretend like it was all over. I got accepted into a great college and I was for the first time a little excited for a change in my life. \n\nMy first semester didn\u2019t work out. Even though I had great friends and amazing professors and had a perfect GPA after midterms, all the faking it caught up to me and I started ditching classes, ignoring old friends, not eating or sleeping, and really just laying in bed except when occasionally hanging out with friends. My advisor and psychiatrist from school reached out to my parents since I was failing all my classes with no attempts to fix it and was planning suicide again. When I went home for winter break they all decided that I would have to take a semester off and stay home. I was pissed because I just wanted a second chance or even a choice but because I have an illness I didn\u2019t get either and I was going to be stuck at home all alone with nothing to do except the therapy that I had always hated and never worked. \n\nI started seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist, and for the first time it felt like I actually liked them and we didn\u2019t spend every session with long empty silences where I answered everything with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d (I think that it\u2019s always been easier for me to talk to guys instead of girls for some reason and I finally asked to see male doctors instead of being too embarrassed to say anything). But after six months of working with them and trying new meds and rTMS, nothing has really changed. \n\nEven though I don\u2019t really feel different, everyone is on board and planning for me to go back to school next semester, since that\u2019s what I wanted and pleaded for from the start. But I don\u2019t feel the least bit excited, hopeful, or even curious about going back and what that\u2019s gonna be like. I just don\u2019t care. Wanting to die has always been at the top of my list, but I\u2019ve always pushed through by figuring out and settling with a solid number two is, if that makes sense. I guess I\u2019ve always thought, \u201cwell, if I\u2019m not going to die right now, I guess I\u2019ll just do XYZ.\u201d But now things just feel so empty and exhausting that I don\u2019t want to settle. I just want to die and the feelings have just been consuming every second of everyday. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t want to tell my therapist bc I don\u2019t want him to help me or try and stop me. I don\u2019t want to stay home another semester or transfer or change any of that. I just want to die. I\u2019ve stopped talking to friends bc I found myself relying on them too much to an unhealthy level for both sides to the point where I lost a few of my closest friends, so I just don\u2019t talk about any of it anymore with them. It just feel like my mind is constantly thinking about and planning suicide. I\u2019ve always felt like me killing myself is inevitable, but now it feel like how I did back before I was hospitalized. My brain is screaming at me to just end it all and nothing helps to shut it up. We\u2019re currently on a family vacation doing super active things like hiking, but even during super intense exercise I can\u2019t get my mind to just stop. I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I start thinking about how, when, where, and other details a lot more seriously than I did when it was just my usual rumination. I just want my life to be over and I don\u2019t care or even want the possibility of getting better. I\u2019d rather just be dead. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this ended up being more of a incomprehensible rant than anything else. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m looking for or want anyone can really say to help. Thank you for reading any of it, even if you don\u2019t have anything to say, I appreciate it.",

            "question": "So... first post here, as well as it's my first time dating a girl. She's diagnosed with BPD (borderline).\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, i met a girl through LoL (League of Legends) and we started talking a lot with each other, like, everyday. As soon as we both wake up, we give each other good morning through whatsapp (every single day, until today) and begin talking until bedtime (except for when we're doing everyday stuff, like studying or working). We play a lot too, almost everyday. But... the big problem here is that we live 550 miles away from each other. That makes a HUGE difference when it comes to a BPD person. Even I, who never dated or had any kind of relationship with anyone before can tell that it would be a looot easier if we lived closer. Even though, we have a really good relationship, i would say. I try to avoid unnecessary discussions and she's really cool in general after all, even with her numerous problems. Besides that, we get along really well with each other. We have a lot of good times together. \n\nGoing a little back in time now, i'll talk about her in specific. So, she's been getting along with depression for more than a decade now and just recently she managed to get help from her parents, right after her last suicide attempt (which she barelly got out alive). At this time, we weren't talking yet. She got help from her parents and from the best therapists in town. She got better and started a nursing college: that's when we started talking. We first saw each other after the first 3 months talking through whatsapp, and after that, we started seeing each other barely once in a month. Even with all the problems surrounding us (families denial, because of the distance; her mental condition; i'm still studying for my law degree and don't have a job), we decided to try and begin a relationship. It's been 1 year and 3 months as i write this post down.  \\* Important notes: she takes drugs everyday, twice a day because of her mental condition; lately, her illness is getting out of control.\n\nThe problem:\n\nAbout 3-4 months ago, she dropped off of nursing college and began studying for a medicine college. This is where it all begins to fall apart. With all the pression around her, along with her low self-esteem (assuming that she's not able to pass for a medicine college), her mental health started to shake. The last couple months, because she's mentally and emotionally unstable, we started to discuss and fight a lot more than before, which only made the whole situation worse than ever and we almost broke up with each other a couple days ago. We managed to pull things together and reconcile.\n\nBut... her mental state is terrible and i'm getting desperate, as she's talking about self-harming and suicide. The day before i post this, she got into a real bad discussion with her mother, which made it EVEN worse than it already was. \n\nShe doesn't want to play with me anymore, as well as she's not into doing anything with me as she was before. She just doesn't want too. When i talk to her, it seems that i'm the only one talking, she just answer things like 'no', 'yes', 'i don't know', and 'maybe' to everything i say.\n\nI hope this whole story isn't so confusing to understand (i'm brazilian), i wrote it down the best way i could.\n\nNow, the whole point of this topic is to get an advice, ANY advice at all. \n\nShe's talking about killing herself and self-harming, at the same time she asks me not to tell her parents about anything. She said that she would kill herself without me even knowing it, and i would only get to know it through her parents, after she did it. She's saying to me things like: 'i don't wanna live anymore' and 'i need you HERE with me, not 550 miles away...'. She says that with me at her side, in person, it would be a lot easier to get through things. She says it's unfair, me being 550 miles away. And there's nothing i can do: i can't afford more than 1 monthly trip to visit her. I just CAN'T be with her everyday, like a normal couple would be. I never felt so powerless in my life and this whole thing is making me really sad. I'm sad that she's crying everyday and there's not much i can do to help her, while her mom and dad don't know how to deal with her syndrome, they're only making it worse and worse. I'm feeling like i'm watching her go away, with nothing to do to stop it. I'm desperate that she's on the brink of breaking up with me. And i'm really really sad, cause i miss playing and talking to her like we used to do before, she just doesn't fell like doing it anymore, like everything else in her life. I miss my girl, and by my girl i mean the girl who would always cheer me up and invite me to play with her, cause she loves playing with me... by my girl, i mean the one who would happily talk to me all day when she has the chance... she just... doesn't wanna do any of that anymore... someone help me, i don't know what to do.

I know it will go unnoticed in the torrent of posts here, but it's a good as place any to say anything, after all I'm on the internet.\n\nThe only reason I'm posting this here is that in case someone replies, I have someone to talk to, even if for a moment. I know I sound very edgy or a sissy for saying these things, or even using the word sissy, but its been months since I've had a good conversation with someone, anyone. I honestly can remember the last time I talked with someone which wasn't a yes or no question. It seems like there is no point anymore.\n\nI saw a post here about someone asking what would the women be most sad about being a man, and the number of people replying to it gave a bit confidence to post this. I even wrote something on that post, but thinking that who would wanna listen to me, I deleted the entire thing.\n\nIts just a bit hard to say something if all your life people have told you that your opinion dont matter and that you have no say what so ever in how things are done. Honestly, this is the longest text I've written in ages, or written anything on my phone for that matter. I mean, do people judge other people this extensively?? I know about the situation of Jews and African people and all, but this is the first time I've experienced this in such close quarters and on such personal level. I would be lying if I said I haven't contemplated suicide or running away, but then again, I was told that I'm a scared little shit who will amount to nothing, and I guess it did came true, cz thats what I see everytime I look in the mirror. Just sad guy looking at himself in the mirror for a good 15 min, not saying or doing anything. Just standing there, looking at your reflection thinking nothing.\n\nI cant remember the last time I felt something. I cant remember the last time I cried, like really cried, or felt anything for that matter. Most times it just feels derivative to live, like whats the point in living if all the days are same.

            "question": "I feel this way far too often.... I\u2019m 22yo and I want to die almost every day. As time goes on, the thoughts of suicide increased and seem more and more appealing. It started to get scary for me once I realized that the one thing stopping me from actually offing myself (the pain I would cause others around me) didn\u2019t matter to me anymore and that dying would be worth it. Because id be dead and nothing would matter. The only thing stopping me now is the fear of becoming paralyzed or failing the attempt and having to live with that. So I just hope every day I get hit by a car on my way to work or die by some kind of freak accident. I feel so alone all the time even though I have supportive friends/family. While I\u2019m not alone physically, mentally I can\u2019t help but feel worthless and like people hate me. I know the cliche of people telling depressed people that they\u2019re \u201cnot a burden\u201d I just feel like that\u2019s untrue. I feel like this issue is consistent enough that having to have someone help me and comfort me when I become this way prevents them from living their best life and it takes away from their happiness. I know that being around me is not easy when I am depressed or having an anxiety attack. I have a really hard time verbalizing my thoughts and feelings because I feel like if I don\u2019t say them out loud then they won\u2019t be as real. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working very hard on these last few years but it\u2019s still a work in progress. I know that might sound crazy but it\u2019s just how I rationalize my lack of coping mechanisms I guess. I feel like I can pinpoint all of my issues and I\u2019m pretty self aware. I want to change desperately but for some reason I can never pull myself out of the void once I feel myself sink in. And it\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s hard for the close ones around me trying to help. I can\u2019t let them in no matter how much I want to. I just feel like there\u2019s only so much someone can do before giving up on you. It tears me up inside. I\u2019m worried about my relationship failing because of my inability to fight the depression. We\u2019ve been together nearly 6 years and he is the most amazing and supportive person I\u2019ve ever met. But a person can only take so much for so long. In my opinion anyways. I lay in bed most of the day usually sleeping or watching videos when I\u2019m not working my full-time job + a part-time job to just barely be able to pay my bills. The financial stress of being 22 years old, fully self sufficient, living in a big city is insane. I have a history of disordered eating that I\u2019ve noticed resurface this past year. I eat, on average, maybe 6-8 small meals a week. I know eating helps stabilize mood but my ED makes me actually physically nauseous even just thinking about food. Attempting to eat triggers my gag reflex and I\u2019ve puked on several occasions just trying to satiate myself. I just try to tell myself that these thoughts are temporary and that better times will come and make living worth it. I don\u2019t know if I even believe that but trying to have some optimism helps a little. Ive used marijuana as a crutch to help deal with my ED/depression for years, smoking several times daily. I actually just decided last week that it\u2019s time for a break (hopefully to quit permanently). I feel like it used to help but it has just started to hurt me and I haven\u2019t even enjoyed smoking for a long time I just do it out of habit. I feel like it\u2019s making me stupid. On top of my depression that I also feel makes me stupid. Obviously I know healthy diet, exercise/meditation/breath work help symptoms. But committing and forcing myself to do these things regularly seems nearly impossible for me. I can\u2019t find joy or interest in ANYTHING. Which makes it really hard to distract my mind from my thoughts. Antidepressants/anxiety medications (viibryd) have also helped me in the past but I\u2019m not financially stable enough currently to go see a doctors. And I\u2019m not feeling this way every day, it comes and it goes. But it comes and goes fairly frequently. frequently enough that it gets insanely exhausting having to constantly regulate my thoughts and tell myself to snap out of it. If I repress, things get worse. If I let it out, I spiral out of control. I\u2019m not looking for people to tell me that things get better, I\u2019m hoping someone can offer useful guidance, tips or advice to maybe help me pull myself out of the void when I fall in. I hope someone can relate and find comfort knowing they\u2019re not alone. Deep down I know I\u2019m not alone but all logic gets thrown out the window once the cloud comes over my head.",

I relate to having no motivation or interest in learning anything or trying anything new. I relate to how it comes and goes. When it comes, I feel doomed and like a waste of human life. And when it goes I feel guilty and question if i just made up the depression in my head and i\u2019m just being dramatic for attention.. \nI\u2019m 19f I may not have much useful guidance to offer but feel free to message me if you want someone to talk to."

            "question": "Hey all, I have had depression and anxiety since my teen years (I'm 28F), usually for me that means really low self-esteem, I'm exhausted constantly, I don't like being around people for long periods of time, lots of crying, trying not to kill myself, etc. \nI got married to my husband (28M) last month after a little over a year of dating, and although he's known I have these issues the last year has been pretty easy for me. Unfortunately I'm going through a pretty bad depression right now where I'm literally trying not to break down at work, I'm fighting committing suicide almost daily, and it's really causing some issues. I've never really had to deal with my depression where it is effecting someone else before, and it's not going very well. \n\nMy husband is not a very supportive person, I have tried talking to him about what I'm going through and he just doesn't understand, and he gets angry when he doesn't get it. I'm crying and feeling awful, and he's pissed off bc \"other people have it way harder than us\".\n\nYesterday after days of fighting and work being extremely stressful I posted on a different sub about needing support because I was considering not coming home and killing myself and he saw it, and flipped out on me. He told me I need to get help or he's divorcing me. His idea of me getting help is having this person from church pray over me. Which I've had done before, and it did help for a while, but obviously it didn't miraculously take my depression away for good.\n\nI need help. I'm going to find a therapist. But I know this is something that I'll likely be dealing with on and off the rest of my life. How do I pretend like everything is ok in front of my husband so he doesn't get angry and divorce me? \n\nTLDR; I have depression, my husband doesn't like it. Told me to get help or he's divorcing me. Are there any tips or tricks to acting like everything is fine? No, I'm not going to divorce him if I can help it.",

                "You've made valid points, he's never been a compassionate person, he isn't really affectionate at all unless he wants to have intercourse, and is completely ignorant to my situation, and at this point I'm just drowning in despair thinking I'm going to have to hide my emotions for the rest of my life.

                "sorry post longer than I expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm really sorry both of you are in this situation. It sucks that this is happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nimagine theres a young couple where the woman has multiple sclerosis. They come together, she has good and bad days, but a pretty fair year, (the illness in its early stages), and then they get married. Not far into their marriage, she has an episode where the illness is quite debilitating; she cant do normal stuff and is miserable. Her husband - having not seen what an episode like this looks like before - says \"you need to try harder to get better. You clearly would not be this ill if you just put in more effort to getting better\". So the young woman sees more doctors (she's already seen a number, and takes more meds). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later, another episode happens. This one worse than the previous one. The husband, frustrated with his wife for being unwell, says \"You need to try even harder to get better. If you put in more effort we wouldnt have to put up with the inconvenience of your illness\". So the wife goes off, sees a new specialist, doubles her meds, and for another few months things are ok. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she feels another episode coming on. She know that if he finds out about it, he will be angry with her, for being ill, and for it being her fault that she is ill, so she hides it from him. Over time, there are a number of episodes, and she gets really good at keeping them hidden. Eventually he thinks she is in remission, and stops bugging her to work harder to get better. in the mean time, she is horribly unwell, and suffering a lot, but she does this alone in the marriage because she doesnt want to upset him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes on for a couple of years. The couple buy a house, build a lot of deep, close, social relationships together. Get very close to each others families, buy some houses, have a number of mortgages and investments together, and have a child. One of them knows things are hanging on a knife edge, and the other is blissfully unaware. This is the foundation their relationship is built on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust after the child is born, her illness gets very severe and she ends up in hospital for 3 months. The prognosis is not good. She finally has to tell him whats been happening. He realises this whole time she has been deceiving him so that he wont leave her. Because she is in hospital and very unwell, she cant care for the baby. He has to quit his job, and stay home and do the child care 24/7. He is angry, sleep deprived, resentful, and feels like his whole life was a lie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you see where Im going with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate to tell you this, but depression can be a serious vulnerability. We dont have the same resilience to the slings and arrows that life throws at us, as other people do. Things that others might hold up against, can make us very unwell, incapacitated, and can sometimes, literally, be fatal to us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have an illness. The illness is not your fault. Its not who you are. However, its a 'comes with the package' thing. If he loves you, he *has to* be able to love your illness too. He can not do this if you are not open with him about how this affects you. And the reason is really simple; right now, everything in your lives is ok: things are great and you both have a lot to be thankful for. You need to think about all the things that will happen to both of you in the course of your lives together, and be realistic about the trajectory of your illness. Yes, its possible you could get better. That could happen. There is also the possibility that you could get worse - a lot worse; and he needs to know that and be able to handle it if it occurs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe may be doing you both a favour this early on by putting up his hands and saying \"this is too hard\". Because it means you can do what needs to be done before things get complicated in your lives. Before there's any real difficulty. Because if you are ill now with everything peachy, you have to think about whats going to happen between the two of you when they are not - and if this thing really takes hold. Its just not fair to pretend you are in a situation you are not in. Its deceiving him, and setting him up for false expectations. If he cant handle you as you are; thats great - it gives you the opportunity to find someone who accepts everything about you, and can stay with you no matter what - through better or worse, through sickness and in health. Because thats what you need. A 'fair weather friendship' is not a solid foundation for marriage.",
                "&gt; Yesterday after days of fighting \n\nDepression can make people more irritable than usual. You may be getting more upset at him than you usually would. That's something that both of you could be mindful of during this period. I think of it like this sometimes: depression wants people to get into fights, supportive partners/friends need to try to avoid taking the bait. If he's getting frustrated with you while you're going through this, then he should go take a walk to cool off (and you could try the same).\n\nAnyway, the fighting doesn't help. It's hard to talk about this stuff, but if you think you're argumentative and getting more annoyed than usual, then you may want to tell him (if you haven't already) that you're current mood is more argumentative than possible and it would be helpful if he could be more patient and try not to engage in fighting. That's a big ask because you're essentially saying something along the lines of \"please don't fight with me when I fight with you\" which is a little weird to hear, but you're not feeling well right now and could use a little more love than you might be able to give at the moment.\n\n&gt;How do I pretend like everything is ok in front of my husband so he doesn't get angry and divorce me? \n\nYou don't. I've suffered through my own episodes and now I'm the partner of somebody going through an episode. When I was depressed, it helped me to talk about what I was going through with people that let me just air it out (great benefit of having friends that go through it too or a therapist). Plus, it was helpful to set expectations for people near me. \"Hey, I'm in a bad place right now and I keep getting these feelings that make me want to start fights and not be very close with people. It's not your fault, and when I'm feeling better I'll be the friend you're used to.\" People that care can generally reflect on a statement like that and adjust to be able to be there with you during this period.\n\nYour husband told you to get help. He's right, even if his motivation is wrong. One of the reasons you could benefit from seeing a therapist is to talk to somebody that understands why you're upset that your husband doesn't seem to be supporting you right now.\n\nFrom my own experiences, keeping things in and pretending to be okay led me to get deeper and deeper into my own depressing thoughts without having somebody help me see that things aren't as bad as I thought they were. If you're not feeling great, then you should be able to say that and your husband should be able to work with you to figure out how to get through this.",
                "Thank you for your response, you gave me another perspective to look at. I would agree that we should just divorce, because I don't want to deceive my friend, or my lover. But I don't feel like either of those things to him. We aren't friends. I'm just playing a role for him. I'm eventually going to take care of his home, and his children, cook for him, and clean, and please him in bed. As long as I do those things he won't care how I feel. I think the only reason he is threatening me with divorce is because it's causing me to divert from my normal schedule. It's effecting him, so he doesn't want me to feel this way. So if I can figure out how to get over my emotional state in front of him he won't care anymore.",
                "I've asked him to be more gentle with me, but he doesn't listen. I am looking to find a therapist through my insurance, I know I need to get help, and I agree talking about my problems helps. He doesn't want to listen to my problems, and he doesn't like working through things. It also makes me feel worse to complain to him about things, like I'm ungrateful for the life he's giving me. I just need to find a way to get through this without it effecting him. Thank you for the response, I really appreciate your insight, and your time. :)",
                "&gt; I really appreciate your insight, and your time. :) \n\nNo problem! It's nice to support one-another!\n\n&gt; He doesn't want to listen to my problems, and he doesn't like working through things. \n\nYou're going through a tough time right now, so this might be a difficult period for you to try to work on what sounds like a significant relationship hurdle. This just furthers my thought that you could use somebody to talk to about what you're going through that won't argue with you about it. After you take care of yourself, you can then try to work on your relationship (if that's what you want to do).\n\n&gt; like I'm ungrateful for the life he's giving me \n\nIf that's the message that he's giving you, then that's unfortunate. And if that's something that you're telling yourself, then I think you're being too tough on yourself.\n\nYou're going through something that is essentially an illness. That doesn't mean you're not being grateful. That means you're going through a tough time. I hope you feel better soon, and I hope your husband can be more understanding."

            "question": "I've had severe depression for over 2 years, depression and Rei obsession started around December 2016. I also have severe anxiety and high functioning autism.\n\nDepression started due to mainly loneliness and not being able to be with the perfect waifu Rei Ayanami who I'd just discovered at the time. I love Rei so much and I'd do anything to be with her. She's simply perfect for me. She was one of the main causes of my depression, not being able to be with her. but there were other factors which caused my depression over 2 years ago. I've been deathly obsessed with Rei ever since I got my depression, and being suicidal over her and other things countless times, even since I got my depression.\n\nI'll explain how I found Rei. it's a bit lewd so ignore it if you wish. Found a lewd meme of Rei which was just high detail plugsuit art of her and I thought she was cute and hot, which then led me to eventually finding the Rei subreddit out of interest and also Discord server which I helped make (Which both soon completely betrayed me like a year later since they found out I'd never watched Evangelion.) then very shortly after, I became deathly obsessed and even planned to end it all for her back then, which was also one of my closest times I've been to attempting suicide.\n\nAnd I did mention I've never even watched Evangelion, and I'll explain why. I'm deathly afraid of it, though I'm fine with a few like art and stuff, aka stuff I'm already used to. The unsafe stuff though gives me extreme anxiety attacks and makes me cry instantly. I also cry randomly whenever I think of Rei or not at all. (When I cry over Rei it's over my love for her.) The reasons why I'm deathly afraid of Evangelion are being scared I'll have my vision of Rei ruined/destroyed, that she or any other character gets hurt or is in emotional pain or anything which I know happens, that Asuka will simply give me stress attacks as tsunderes cause that for me and Iknow enough to know that Asuka is a very abusive tsundere, and any emotional or intense part such as the music for example. Those are my reasons.\n\nBefore you say anything, yes I did try to watch it around the 1st of March, and over these 2+ years already before I tried, I already had a fair bit of knowledge about Evangelion. Now I'll explain my attempt at watching it after all this time back in March. I was watching it with 3 other people from Discord who I trusted who supported me all the way through and let me go at my own pace. I had to pause so much because there were so many times where I was just really affected or nervous or scared, that I had to pause. It was hell for me. There were a lot of parts which hurt me a LOT, such as Shinji's breakdown over not wanting to pilot. The final straw was when Rei first appeared on the strecher and I just had to quit, I couldn't take it anymore and I 100% didn't want to see Rei in pain 1 bit. After I quit, I needed a few days to recover but it didn't help when the Rei server owner abused me yet again and banned me again for not watching enough of it even though he made a deal that if I tried to watch Evangelion, he'd let me go. Anyway, ever since then, I never want to try and watch Evangelion again. The attempt hurt me so much.\n\nBack to my depression, I've tried antidepressants, even moving up a dose, and I have also had multiple therapists, all of this at the same time for a while, all useless. So ever since then, ages ago, I've given up hope and tried to just live with everything. Gave up around like October 2018?\n\nI don't even know what to do anymore, and I don't really want to live the rest of my life like this, but it seems I have no option anyway.",

                "Hey Rose, I was on the same boat as you a few years ago. I lost had my basketball scholarship after tearing my ACL and getting in a car wreck, shattering my hand, both within a few months of each other. I couldn't play the same game again. Two years after, I  lost my girlfriend of four years to suicide after she was raped causing a miscarriage of our 4 month-year-old. I can't say I never thought about suicide but I guess I loved myself too much to follow through with it. I'd cut my shoulder until blood dripped from my fingertips because it was easier to hide the mental pain with physical. I can't say there's a magical pill that will make the pain all go away but I do know pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, a day, or even a year but eventually, it will subside. I got up every day went to school, put on a smile and made it one day at a time. It wasn't easy but if I hadn't I wouldn't be where I am today and if I had to go through all the therapy sessions, if I hadn't stripped myself of my medication and healed naturally with the help of my psychologist. I would still be relying on those pills. Gotta take the bull by the horns and get up and show up no matter what even if it's just a baby step as small as making your bed in the morning. At least you can say you did something that day."

You may think I\u2019m depressed because I want to be tall. Wrong. I actually want to be short. \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to be short. I thought it was always so cool. They don\u2019t have to bump heads on walls. They don\u2019t have to have a hard time with several things (such as legs hanging off of bed, shower too short, etc.). They can fit into kids clothes, which saves them money (especially shoes). My mom is 5\u20192\u201d and my dad is 5\u201910\u201d. My oldest sister is 5\u20190\u201d (she stunted her growth) and my middle sister is 5\u20195\u201d. I am younger than both sisters and no other siblings. I have been told things like \u201cthis kid stretched, this kid will be able to carry his dad on his shoulder soon, by the time your oldest sister comes you will be a head taller than her\u201d etc. probably because they assume I want to be tall. I told my mom I don\u2019t think I will be any taller than 5\u20198\u201d (which is way taller than I want to be, I want to be 5\u20192\u201d-5\u20196\u201d, goal is to be a 5\u20194\u201d adult), and she replied \u201coh son 5\u20198\u201d is too short. I think you\u2019re growing everyday.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell my parents I want to be short, I just asked them to sign me up for psychology because I feel depressed. I told them I would tell them this evening. I have been doing several things to try and stunt my growth. My mom forced me to drink 2 cups of milk a day. I pour the 2nd cup down the drain, the first one I have to drink in my cereal bowl for breakfast everyday. I tried to lift a 15 pound weight above my shoulder while squatting (I am weak), I did it for the past 2 weeks, but yesterday my mom caught me and locked up the weight with a combination lock that she has the combo hidden on her phone (with a 6-digit passcode on her phone). I have been keeping myself awake and only been getting 7.5 hours of sleep, have not been caught. \n\nDepression is genetic in our family. My 5 ft sister (lucky bastard) had an eating disorder (I stopped eating several foods such as eggs, oatmeal, and chicken because I don\u2019t wanna grow tall), my middle sister has anxiety attacks, my aunt tried to commit suicide once, my uncle tried to commit suicide as well, and my dad\u2019s dad committed suicide before my lucky bastard sister was even born. \n\nDo you have any advice for how I can be short (not get shorter, just maintain my height/stop growing), do you have a predicted height for how tall I might be?

We were schoolmates during senior high but we never got close through personal talks BUT we chat about stuff in our friend's group chat. He is a very cheerful, humorous person.\n\nSo just recently, about 2 or 3 hours ago actually, he chatted our group chat announcing that he had just got back from the hospital after a suicide attempt. It made me reconsider a lot of things I've been contemplating &amp; planning to do lately. I don't think I want to go through with \"ending\" myself now.\n\nI messaged him, and we talked about stuff and he opened up how his parents were mad at him for attempting, how he feels tired of pretending to be a happy-go-lucky person saying dark jokes and sharing memes and talking about TV series. It was a long story, but he let out a lot of stuff and I just listened to him and told him I support and care for him even when we haven't talked to each in person at school. He told me thank you because people barely message him stuff like this, and that he feels \"left out\". I did not expect that he was going through this the whole time. After we chatted I told him no problem and to feel better soon.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThis second one is about \"E\"\n\n( He's the guy my other previous posts are referring to -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bu7vhp/advice_to_an_18_yo_depressed_closeted_bisexual/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bz5p1b/ive_written_drafts_of_my_notes_for_2_people_so_far/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share )\n\nI've decided to finally reach out to him by messaging him. We promised to catch up with each other for months. It was a shorter chat, but I just wish I've done this sooner. He helped a lot in the past when I was going through a bad time about a year and a half ago.\n\nI'm not a firm believer in religion nowadays (and I'm also bi and still in the closet) but I regret not chatting him and that I just went away. I just didn't know how to say it. When I should've just chatted him without overthinking things. He's really going through a hard time, and I just want to tell him I'm sorry I wasn't there during the majority of Grade 12. But now I hope I'm not too late. I hope we can catch up. I need to make things right.\n\nI'm wishing everyone well. Peace.",

I went to England 12 years back to complete my studies. Although not being a bright student but I did manage to successfully complete my studies and secure a suitable job. Salary was beyond my expectation and I started living life of my dream. Traveling, shopping, partying inshort I was living a lavish lifestyle. But time never stays the same, I had a brain haemorrhage attack and was hospitalized for a week with a successful operation. But I was unable to work for months hence lost my lost. After the recovery I started another job to survive. By this time I started missing my family  and came to know that my mother back home is diagnosed with last stage cancer. It broke me into pieces as my mother was the only best friend I had to whom I used to share all my feelings and thoughts. I spoke with her over a call and she said she wants me to get married in her life and thats her only last wish.\nAs the time passes I found a girl in my office who was from the same back home country as me. Although she was in different department but we knew each other. I asked her for a dine out and she agreed. Once we met I told her everything about me and asked her if she is willing to for a marriage. After 2 days she said yes. We started meeting everyday and started loving each other more and more. After few days I lost my job due to some visa issue and company was not able to sponsor me a visa. I left UK and went to Middle East and found a job there. My mother condition was getting worst day by day and finally doctor gave her a life time of 4 months. We did all the arrangements for wedding in a month time. Everyone was with a crying face at my wedding because of my mother\u2019s medical condition, even me. In short it was a disaster wedding. I didnt know whether to cry for my mother or do a still smile or a laugh for a ridiculous camera shoot.\nAs the time passes me and my wife started useless arguments and fights. She cant control her anger and thats what she also admits and I cant tolerate her anger. I still remember when I proposed her, we asked what are the things we dont need from life. She said I want to study further and make my career. From that day to this date I never came in between her studies or career. I said the only thing which I dont like is fighting and screaming voices coming out from someone\u2019s house. And this is exactly what she gave me in return. We do fight alot even twice a day. At that time there was no financial or sexual issues.\nFew months later my mother passed away. At that time having a bad married life and already cried alot because of mother\u2019s health my heart becomes so strong that I didn\u2019t cry on her death. After passing few more months my father passed away. \nI continued with my job in middle east and started compromising on my married life. Things started getting better and my wife delivered a baby girl. We both were happy until I lost my job in middle east and had to travel back to my home country.\nAs I suffered alot in the past traumas I didn\u2019t have more energy to compromise on marriage. We started fighting again. And now I dont feel like going home. When I come home from work I stay in my car in the car park atleast for 1-2 hours not willing to go home.  Financially I broke down, sexually we dont interect now. We dont have any warmth left in our relationship. I discussed with her about divorce but she is not willing to as she dont want to go back to her father\u2019s house again. I dont like to eat food with her, I dont like to sleep with her, I dont like to talk with her. I become a very quite person I dont make any future plans. If we touch each other it feels like so many ants on the body. I tried alot to make things normal I used to bring gifts for her to make hery happy so that we wont fight more but again next day we fight again. \nI am losing myself, I have no one to share my feelings with. I have suicidal thoughts. It is having a very bad impact on my work, I am not a good and a hard working employee anymore. I see everyone is so happy in there life except me. I lost my confidence when talking with someone I start stammering alot. I am gaining weight and losing energy. I cant sleep at night properly I feel like I am homeless. I cant pay attention to anything, I cant listen and understand what people are saying. I dont like to see my face in the mirror. I dont like to talk. Just want to sit quietly in the dark corner.

            "question": "I have never truly/fully opened up to another individual/s (other than a few close people in the past or a counselor of some sort, but even then it was \"limited\") so here it goes.\n\nI am here seeking help as I have nowhere else to turn. I am flawed, I am broken, I am alone, scared, tired, sad, frustrated, any possible negative feeling one could have I have been dealing with my whole life. I consider myself fairly religious and try very hard to abide in the ways of my Christian faith but I fall every time. Understandable one does not have to be perfect, but I cannot sincerely say that I try to the best of my ability. I am married, been with my SO for close to 15 years and we do have children who are fairly young.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy marriage is not great, but it's not all terrible either. I feel us slowly slipping into the monotony of life and I find myself pushing away from not only them, but family, co-workers, God, everybody. People say I am quite negative at times ( I do not disagree here as I tend to be more realistic about things compared to others, and really look at a problem or an individual for what they truly are). Unfortunately, I have been fighting depression going on half of my adult life, I have never been on any meds (maybe I should be), I do not open up to others (as there is nobody) I have no friends or people I would consider as one. I have shut myself out away from the world, I prefer dark and dreary days, bad weather, staying inside with the curtains and shades closed, I do not talk to my neighbors (or really anybody if I can avoid it) and I stay in a dark room most of the day (at least that's how I prefer it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's hard for me to get up most days and give anything to not only my family, but my job, and all those around me. I feel like its a chore just to put a fake smile or interact just for the sake of doing it. In reality, I feel broken and empty on the inside. I do not find joy in anything but being alone, or sitting in front of some electronic device tuning out the world. There are times where I will cry, and others I only cry on the inside without shedding a tear. I have no hope for my current stage in life, or for my future in that manner. I have stagnated in my career and I do feel this is part of the depression, but I am steadily finding its a little bit of everything that contributes to this great sorrow which haunts me every day. I cannot even describe the feeling of hopelessness, inadequacy, not going anywhere in life, feelings of rejection, etc that consume my life down to its very core.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried taking time for myself, studying in the word, talking with my significant other but to only leave disappointed/unfulfilled from any outside engagement. I have been told in the past that I should seek some outside help, but even talking to a complete stranger (even posting now) I feel like its a waste of time and only a means to another dead road. There are times where I do not wish to exist, but also am afraid to die at the same time (weird right)?  I have had some substance abuse problems in the past, but those days have been gone for a few years and it wasn't really heavy. I essentially was looking for a way out of this depression and chasing a high that would hopefully make me happy. I was wrong, as these feelings were only temporary and they didn't fix anything. I don't know what I am doing most days, other than awakening to repeat the same boring mundane life that I am to live. I have tried mixing things up and adding other activities but those have only been short-lived and always brought me back to this dark place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have always had a difficult life and it was never easy. I have always learned things the hard way and have suffered a great them (even legally). I don't know what I am doing anymore, I feel like my family, career,  finances, religion, everything is slipping away from me (and they are to some extent). No matter how hard I try, I always end up back where I started in complete and utter failure. There are times where I do not will to live, and have contemplated suicide a few times (although they are just thoughts) I'm so tired of being sad and upset at the world, it feels like everybody is doing something with their life except me. I always seem to hit roadblocks not only in my career, but my relationships, and interactions with other people. I feel like I am that 1% of an individual whose life purpose is meant to fail. No matter what. I have never been diagnosed with any mental related issues, I do not consider myself crazy, but I do feel unstable in my feelings at times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have anger issues (always angry), I am sad, anxious, afraid, pretty much every symptom associated with depression, stress, and anxiety (at least so I read). I have thought about up and leaving my family, career, and just leaving to either start a new life, or too get away from it all permanently and go somewhere where I cannot affect/infect others. I do not have any substance abuse problems I am dealing with currently, but I often feel like going back that route even if it is only temporarily or offers even a fiber of happiness/change in feelings. I feel dead inside. I often question my purpose as if I am some mistake that was never supposed to be here. I have lost the will to live, laugh, and love. I do not find joy in anything in life as I only feel joy is only temporary, and It would only take me right back to where I started...a waste of time. I guess this is my cry for help...",

            "question": " I\u2019m here as a person who feels out of options but doesn\u2019t want to commit suicide. I feel so lonely, and it\u2019s crushing me. I\u2019m losing my faith in love (my raison d\u2019etre) and I didn\u2019t realize just how much I needed to believe in *something*. I can and do believe in myself sometimes but sometimes that goes away and I feel empty and alone and unworthy; yet I don\u2019t feel like I truly have anything but myself. I have some friends but none that I would really call a \u201ctrue\u201d friend (I left my old friend group a couple of years ago and, while I feel I was right to do it, I didn\u2019t realize just how hard it would be to establish a new one), and nothing makes me feel as lonely as being around people but still feeling lonely. I feel misplaced and while I take an odd sort of pride in being different I want so desperately to find my people or tribe or however you want to call it and my eccentricities makes it harder to find that.  \n\nI realized recently though that one of the 2 people I really felt I loved didn\u2019t love me but was attached to me because he needed an emotional connection, he felt strongly for me but it was out of desperation and his own neediness rather than for myself. The other was a family member who now loves me as a duty. Now thinking of those 2 fills me with so much sadness. It used to be some kind of comfort that there was *someone* out there with whom I shared love and now I don\u2019t have a single person I really connect with and believe in, and it\u2019s been 4 years since I\u2019ve had active love in my life. I\u2019ve gotten through it by berating and cajoling myself, and utilizing the spare friend group I have but I feel like I can\u2019t bear the emptiness anymore.  \n\nI don\u2019t know that this will help. After reading the other postings and comments it feels like this might exacerbate rather than help my situation but I have to try something.",
            "answer": [
                "Okay, let me try and break this into smaller parts.\n\nFirst of all I'd like to address your concern that any comments might make your situation worse. I guess we agree if one feels the world around them sucks it is absolutely normal to be affected by all sorts of triggers. But there are several arguments for you to not be affected negatively: in this subreddit I very rarely see anyone being inconsiderate, and I think I've never seen it done on purpose. Also people don't fully know you, only you decide what to take away. Plus the purpose of you writing was to get something good out of it to begin with.\n\n&gt;I didn\u2019t realize just how much I needed to believe in *something*. \n\nWell I'd just like to say that is true for everyone I guess. We all operate under some sort of belief system, regardless of how inconsistent it might be at times. And believing in nothing is still some sort of belief. So please don't feel particularly sad if you're taking some time to readjust your system (that's actually quite healthy) or if you temporarily feel there is nothing particularly strong among your beliefs. We're all here just for the ride.\n\n&gt;  I\u2019m losing my faith in love (my raison d\u2019etre) and I didn\u2019t realize just how much I needed to believe in *something*. I can and do believe in myself sometimes but sometimes that goes away and I feel empty and alone and unworthy; yet I don\u2019t feel like I truly have anything but myself. \n\nI think it's different to say I believe a theory and different to say I believe in a person. Here by believing in love I assume you mean that all people innately deserve to be loved and by believing in yourself I assume you mean you believe you can do without love and be on your own. If so, I'd like to point out that these two can go together. You can still believe in love but also realise that you're quite strong on your own. There's no shame in admitting that you would like to be loved but you're still ok without it (I'm also self-projecting a bit here, I've been alone for way more than 4 years, and I have a few good friends but I can't say I completely trust them).\n\n&gt; and unworthy \n\nThat would be true if people got what they deserved. Is there sufficient proof though for you to deem yourself unworthy? I don't think so!\n\n&gt; while I take an odd sort of pride in being different I want so desperately to find my people \n\nYou don't have to be similar to others to find love or find a good buddy/buddies that get you, among them.\n\n&gt; The other was a family member who now loves me as a duty. \n\nThe example of the needy person you mentioned - I can't deny it might suck. But regarding family being loved as a duty is not a very bad or uncommon thing, we don't get to choose family. I honestly think my parents don't like me that much. But who cares. We love each other very much anyway. For whatever it's worth, don't worry too much about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I think I have mostly commented on how loneliness and your temporary lack of raison d\u2019etre as you said might make you depressed. Having read some of your other posts I understand how not getting a reply here would add to that feeling of loneliness, but it shouldn't. The reason I first came to the subreddit is because I was procrastinating immensely and being an expert on my own misery I thought I may offer some insight to people. It's all so circumstantial.\n\nRegarding loneliness itself, are you trying to meet new people? Are you \"shuffling the deck\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my longest posts for sure. Hope it helped you a bit. Let me know.",
                "Thanks for your comments :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll address them all in order:\n\nIt's not toxic comments that I'm worried abt, it's abt encouraging a cycle of reading and feeling overwhelmed by the scope of this issue at a time when I feel generally overwhelmed myself. I did spend time mired in sad reddit posts. But eventually I did turn some small amount of attention to trying to help on some level, at least by acknowledgement. So, that's better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lack of beliefs is different than a belief in nothingness and while we are excellent at adapting there are areas that we are less adept at changing. I guess I would also make a distinction btwn belief as in having confidence in something quantifiable (science, math, physics) and belief as in faith in something abstract like love or for others god/s. A loss of belief in religion is often traumatic and on some level I've idealized love to the point where it is very close to a religion for me. I agree that adapting is healthy but an intrinsic aspect of a belief system is that it's an anchor of a kind, something to turn to in times of turmoil or change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to my definition of love I do mean not so much that all people deserve to be loved but that my concept of love might be an impossible. And while there is a difference btwn theory and an example when it comes to something as abstract and lacking in definition as love, an example of it is crucial for me to have confidence that it exists as I picture it. I want and sometimes feel I need a person I can rely on in the times when I, as everyone does, feel uncertain. I'm not ashamed that I want to be loved but I am lost without someone I feel I love. I love my parents and brothers as a duty but it is an insufficient love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the use of the word \"unworthy\" it's a word that I felt as an assessment of myself as a replacement for the lack of love and another person to believe in. I know this will likely sound rude, and I don't mean to be, but you lack sufficient proof to deem me worthy of anything but basic human rights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone is different but the relationship I crave are those built on some kind of substance (similarity in ideas, interests, activities) or it's a bit insufficient. I don't like to have friends just to pass the time with them but to have stimulating conversation, learning, and teaching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is similar to my feelings on love as a familial duty, love for me can never be a duty. It is so beautiful and elusive because it cannot be forced. My familial love fails to make me feel the kind of love I'm looking for. And I don't just mean romantic love, I mean a love that is based on substance not duty or circumstance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry that you're so familiar with misery and I thank you for reaching out and trying to utilize the lessons you learned to help others. That's a behavior I would like to increase myself. If you want to exchange a bit more, feel free to dm me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess by now you've realized I have strong preferences. I do pursue the connections that I find that I think could lead to a real relationship, romantic or not, I just don't come across that many people who share my interests. When I am around people who I don't really have much in common with I tend to feel lonely among people which is a particularly poignant kind of loneliness for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll close with reiterating my apologies for unintentional rudeness to someone who was generous enough to reach out.

It\u2019s not fair for her to blame you for small things like that or for you to blame yourself. No one is perfect all the time. You have a right to be human and that means sometimes you\u2019re going to be cranky and stuff. A relationship requires both people to try. It seems like you\u2019re the only one trying and you\u2019re blaming yourself while she just flops around like a sad little fish. It kind of sounds like she\u2019s not that invested into dying because she\u2019s got all kinds of excuses for things. That\u2019s a good thing, no one wants her to die. What did her therapists say about it? I don\u2019t know her personally so I can\u2019t be positive, but it seems like she\u2019s pitying herself and she doesn\u2019t know how to snap out of it. Have you tried tough love? Like maybe finding something she would normally like and then just drag her ass there (not literally drag) Some people really are the type that really enjoy wallowing in their own sorrow and making people pity them. Unfortunately it\u2019s hard to tell between people who do that and people who actually are close to hurting themselves. You also have to remember that you deserve a life as well. You are very young and have your whole life ahead of you. You can\u2019t spend the rest of your life chasing after her, tending to her every need, blaming yourself for being human, and begging her not to kill herself. If she is putting you in that position then she\u2019s technically emotionally abusing you. I can see that you really care about her and I know she\u2019s telling you she wants to die, but you should absolutely NOT help her do it because I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a crime. There\u2019s no reason to throw your life away for that. I think she can get better but maybe she might be stuck in her ways, she\u2019s probably so used to feeling this way she doesn\u2019t know any other way to feel. I wonder if there are any books or anything that could help her? Maybe she needs to relearn how to live and enjoy life. If you honestly get to the point where nothing is working and you aren\u2019t happy in the relationship, then you shouldn\u2019t feel too bad about leaving. I know that\u2019s easier said than done. You deserve to be happy too. She complains about being her grandma\u2019s caretaker and uses it as an excuse, but does she notice what you\u2019re giving up to take care of her?",

It'll make me happy, finally find peace with the husband in my dreams\". Gave me chills. But I understand. \n\nYea. Her friends were long gone after graduation. Now due to her depression. She only has me. Her trust for others diminishes. I tried to bring her to my family we're all friendly super. She's okay with them. But in the end I know it's her mask. Cuz she opens up to me about it afterwards. Felt like shit when that happens. \n\nI told her one day that mask will be no more and she'll smile for real. That'll be a beautiful day to behold.\n\nWell. Associates that deal with ptsds here require some procedure beforehand. Since private hospitals are expensive and we don't have much cash to do that. We opt for general hospitals in my area. it's free or at least cost less since her so-called father is working for the govt. Which is dying of cancer currently. God damn to see all these happening.

I\u2019ve tried every option of help, exercise, antidepressants, therapy and counselling and none of them have worked. I\u2019ve been through so much harassment and bullying, going through an abusive relationship that I got out of. Nobody likes me either, I\u2019m a complete outcast and beyond lonely. I contemplate suicide all the time and cry myself to sleep because I\u2019m so alone. I\u2019m not sure how long I can do this anymore. Nobody is supporting me even when I\u2019m so miserable, they just ignore me non stop. I tried to start dating again because being in a relationship actually gave me something to live for but so far I\u2019m unsuccessful because I look horrible. I have no idea what to do or where to go. I have voices in my head insulting me and encouraging me to kill myself and they never stop. I\u2019m addicted to alcohol and can\u2019t put down the bottle.

                "Ihad rather similar issues, I\u2019ll try make it look readable.\n\nFor the first I want to tackle your relationship problem, I felt lonely aswell, deeply lonely, lately I somehow don\u2019t. I got to that point by reading up on some works of Irvin D. Yalom, first \u2019and Nietzsche wept; a novel about obsession\u2019. This one might not fot your creteria, but I can recommend it none the less, my followup on that one was \u2019Staring at the sun; coping with death\u2019, as I realized I wasn\u2019t trying to live the life I wanted to live. My therapist/psychologist told me I\u2019m no good for relationships, and I see the same struggle in your post. Two quotes from Irvin D. Yalom ringed my bell there; \u201dTwo birds with a broken wing stuck together make for clumsy flight\u201d meaning it can work but it\u2019ll be hard, the quote continues telling about how they should heal seperately. The other quote is \u201da life meaning can insue but cannot be persued\u201d, meaning even if you see the light in a relationship it\u2019ll dim over time. \n\n\nYou said you tried therapy, there I gotta ask two questions; Have you tried going inpatient(staying at a hospital/institute to really work with depression)? And how did you tackle therapy?\n  I\u2019ll just presume you were under the influence of medication while in therapy. It\u2019s important to keep them up going for a long while and when you\u2019re \u2019over\u2019 it trying to opt for winter medications.\n  Something from a book I\u2019m working on with trainee psychologists and older psychologists about therapy; Tackling it the right way is key to success, following the \u2019trenches\u2019 of your sickness to the roots they stem from to pluck them out, and then working hard against them. Just a sideway example from personal experience, I got childhood trauma from hateful screaming with my parents, I can do those talks by now but I\u2019ll shiver in fear being afraid to get screamed at, even if it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll get screamed at. So I gotta ease myself into those talks.\n\nA good practical skill in the depressive world is meditation; mindfulness. I recommend reading up on it. It\u2019s a very good skill to silence those inner voices by \u2019becoming aware of being\u2019. It sounds like that bullshit everyone tells you (it did to me when I first heard about it). But after 4 months of daily practice I was able to calm my panick attacks in the matter of a minute. I recommend the free basic course on the headspace app, it\u2019ll be enough to ease you into the topic and the app even tells you how to use it practically.\n\n\nAnother thing on medication, depending on where you live(basically everywhere except the USA) medication is given in a supporting way, not to make you happy but to balance your system into \u201dneutral\u201d mode. Bad periods will still come, they still do for me, but you can be aware of them and start yo work around it, especially since long time medication will grind them down to something handleable.\n\nIf you got any more questiobs or if I should elaborate something just leave a repmy, I\u2019ll see to responding ASAP.",

            "question": "I've been treating depression for a year and half. I first was diagnosed with a moderate to aggravating case of depression and I was put under medicine therapy. After some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I was given some credit by my  psychologist, who have told that didn't really need \"his\" therapy, he gave me the only condition to keep checking psychiatrist every now and then. Since then, I've learned to cope with my \"problematic ordeal\" of finding meaning in anything in life, and I learned that there are some bad days that shouldn't count as the entirety of life. So, up to the preamble:   \n\n\nI've been taking medicines since march, 2018. No serious suicide idealization came since them (actually one episode that evolved cannabis, but this shouldn't count, because cannabis is paranoia material for me) since them i went through escitalopram, some low dosage of  atypical antipsychotic (that didn't work and I quit under the evaluation of a psychiatrist), some benzo for acute paralyzing anxiety, quetiapine to sleep (which later I learn it is falling under new evaluation by the scientific community) and buproprion. I sustained this triad (escitalopram 20 mg, quetiapine 25mg and bup 150mg) for over a year with rare appeals to benzos (I got one prescription and it went out only recently almost a year and a half alway, as I always choose to take 0.5 mg in rare cases only). Recently I went through some doubts about the medicines I was on, this came after I perceived myself unease and incapable of focusing on normal task (even sitting for an entire hour of my former favorite hobby, the video-games). I went to check a new psychiatrist, Dr. Fabiano. He appointed me that I could have (or not, this must be importantly underlined) have suffered the extra-pyramidal effects of the Dopaminergic (bup) or the anti-psychotic (quet), but he couldn't be sure because he although he knew it was possible for someone to present the extra-pyramidal effect under low dosage, as he judge I was on, he could never confirm a \"case like mine\". So, we decided to dump all of three medicines (esc, bup, quet) and switch to a mono-therapeutic usage of Revoc (flavoxamine), which I've been using for a month and some days. NOW COME THE THING: I'm appealing to benzos far more than I ever did. And some times, after the benzo kicks in, I question myself If any other medicine has ever worked for me, because the distinction is quite clear during the effect. I can: \n\n  \n\\* Make clear idea of conflicts\n\n* Have to practice breath and mini doses of meditation\n* Have some good decisions that might impact my later well-fare\n* Study for more than an hour (my limit is way lower, without).\n* Play some video-game and relax\n* Actually listen to music\n* Dance alone, in a dark room with feeling self-pity (maybe the opposite)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know benzo have high potential to become harmful if abused, but since I have developed a wellness relation with it I'm in doubt if any other medicine I took granted me all of these well-fare.",
            "answer": [
                "I'm not a medical professional but I have taken every medicine you mentioned. Quetiapine is used for sleep but is also anti-anxiety. It was very effective for me for anxiety and is used in the States for anxiety(according to my Doc).  This may account for your increase in benzo use when you stopped taking it. Lately benzos have fallen under scrutiny for causing short-term memory loss but I know when I had paralyzing anxiety I didn't care about short-term memory, I could barely breathe. It looks like your old medicines were trying to reach the same result in a different way (less benzo). I have tried so many medicines over the years it kills me. The way I see it that is if you have a medicine combo that works for you then GREAT! I'm happy for you. The quick action of benzos can be quite a relief but, in my experience, for my condition, I need something more. I recently had aripiprazole added to my regimen and I am slowing and hopefully stopping benzos but this is just because my anxiety is greatly reduced and I want to take the least medication possible, not because I have had any ill effects from benzos. I have taken them daily for almost 10 years and I haven't noticed any bad effects, addiction, or increase in dosage. If you are thinking of stopping any of your meds please talk to your doctor first. I have had some serious withdrawal issues with antidepressants. I wish you well!",
                "Man, I almost feel your pain. Short memory loss? I would take it any day instead of the dread of anxiety. But I don't like the drowsiness that come with benzos, you see? And sometimes I feel I'm only sedating a dam pain.\n\nAnd don't worry, I would never cease a medication without proper withdraw treatment. \n\n  \nI hope you get all you need in due time too!\n\nThanks for the reply",
                "Thanks. I know what you mean about the sedation. For me the aripiprazole really kicked the anxiety in the ass. The only reason I'm not off benzos yet is that you can't just stop taking them cold turkey without possible dangerous withdrawal, especially as long as I've been taking them. The aripiprazole is not sedating to me at all and definitely not like quetiapine. I took 50mg of quetiapine one night (25mg normally) and I was a zombie until about 1400 the next day. I have no idea how people take 600-800mg of it and get through their day. Be well.",
                "Update here: I got back to bup and a routine of regular exercise. It is doing wonders. I can really feel rested after a night of sleep. \n\nI propose that a daily simple routine of exercise might save you some pain, if you are under withdraw of benzos. It helps to calm your nerves and focus energy.  I hope anyone that reaches this post for help, end up finding what works for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of wishes."

            "question": " I wish I was prettier so I wouldn't feel so self concious about how I feel when I am outside trying to exist in public. Especially when talking to other \"attractive\" people.  ESPECIALLY when trying to interact with other \"attractive\" women. Or women who \"KNOW\" they are \"the shit\". I hear people like this make gagging noises  after looking at me all the time when I go out in public, like they are disgusted with me or my overall appearance. It makes me want to cry. It happened today at bath &amp; body works. It actually made me want to just kill myself because I can't keep up with everybody else. I don't own gold or fancy rich clothes or any name brands and people out in public seem to keep treating me differently because of that. Especially some of the so called \"attractive\" people here. I swear, there are just some women who \"know\" that they are super attractive, but they just sit there and have an ugly personality by being randomly mean and judgemental to other people. Some of the most \"beautiful\" people I have interacted with, are actually some of the most heartless, mean, ruthless, unempathetic, and down right evil people I have ever met. I hate how our society glamorizes and idolizes this type of behavior. It's narcissitic and self centered as fuck. It's beyond detached from our reality... and yet it is becoming more apart of pur reality because people acting this way has become way more mainstream. Empathy seems to be on an ultimate decline (even science has confirmed that.) I SWEAR social media allows some people to build a following to the point where they feel like a god. These people put themselves first and act like the philosophy of  \"do as thou wilt\" &amp; \"I, myself, am god\" Is all that matters! It honestly sickens me and makes me worry for the future of our humanity. A lot of young people seem to be extremely judgmental, selfish, rude as fuck, and lack empathy. I have noticed even adults are acting this way too. It's actually so common that I think customer service is legit dying off now because human beings are such pieces of shit that we think the next step in human evolution is to become sociopathic un-empathetic human cyborgs that merge with a.i. to become superior humans and our own \"gods\". I think it's all hypocritcal, selfish, evil bullshit &amp; I don't think losing our sense of empathy is a step in the rigjt direction. I don't think it is something human evolution wanted us to purposely try to fuck with or breed out. But without even realizing it, we are breeding it out compassion and empathy from humanity more and more and because of technology, people are not able to feel compassion and empathy the way they used to because they are getting numbed out to it all. I think it was washington post that did an article on the decline of human empathy over the years and it is legit staggering. Scientists say that it's not for the better. We have empathy for a reason to help us survive, without it, we are legit fucked. We will destroy this planet and not even think twice about it because we will lack the ability to do so. I do not think we should lose that aspect of ourselves. It helps drive us to be passionate about things that matter, like global warmimg. Without compassion for the earth, we won't want to save it. Anyways, the reason I am rambling on is because I went outside today with my friend and people that worked inside the store of bath &amp; body works were extremely rude and just judgemental as fuck. It made me feel bad about going outside as an \"ugly person\". I know I am one. I know I am not as bad as other people but to myself, I think I look horrible and not even make up or plastic surgery can fix it. Everyone looks at me like I am too. Random people on the street have looked at me and made gagging noises and laughed.  I guess when you are considered \"ugly\" people aren't afraid to publically mock you. Did you know there used to be things such as \"ugly laws?\" Google them. I feel like even though those laws no longer exist in America. People are still judgemental as fuck and will not let you into a club or store or resturuant if you look or dress a certain way &amp; I believe it is wrong. People these days even seem to act this way towards the elderly and it makes me fucking angry. I believe in respecting our elders. Not making fun of their appearance or treating them like shit just because they walk slow. I really need to rant right now.  I am just so upset. I hate humanity. I really do. People are just so fucking mean and heartless for no fucking reason and don't ever seem to cut anyone any fucking slack. I could be crying, ready to kill myself and people in our society are so fucked up that they are willing to laugh at me and encourage me to kill myself if I'm gonna be so sensitive. Since when did being sensitive become a thing that people encourage others to kill themselves over?!! Like seriously?!! The fucking fuck?! I read Leo Buscgalia's book called \"Love\" &amp; I learned through him that gentleness and kindness and empathy is a strength, NOT a weakness. But our society acts so fucking backwards! I'm honestly beyond upset right now because I went into bath &amp; body works with my friend to go get something for my dad for father's day &amp; the employees were really judgmental and rude. They also wouldn't stop nonstop watching me and acting like I was sketchy just for being in their store. Maybe I don't look the part. I didn't wear make up. My hair is thinning out because I don't have the best genetics. I have ultra thin, fine, hair. It fucking sucks. Nothing I do can make me look attractive. I wash my face twice daily with high end skin care products but I still have acne. I am thin. I'm 130 lbs. I am 5\"5. Boobs are like a B. My nose is very british looking. It kinda droops slightly and has a hump if you look at it from the side. I am pale as fuck and have massive bags under my eyes. My teeth have a slight over bite &amp; are honestly embarrasing to me because they don't look like hollywood perfect teeth. My hair is a shitty looking brown color and I have freckles. I have gauged ears, some people might find it disgusting but I think it's alternative and cool as fuck, vut maybe it contributes to people perceiving me as \"ugly\".  It hurts my feelings a lot. Like why am I ao ugly? Why do people who work at places like the grpcery store or mall think whenever I go out shopping that I'm gonna steal? Like do I look scruffy or something? Like it's because I'm not gorgeous enough to be taken seriously or treated with respect people hover over me and watch me like a hawk? Is that it? Why is it when I go to even buy food or when I go out at all, even when I'm paying with my own money, they act so skeptical over how someone like me would or could ever purchase from them or use their services ! They look and treat me like I'm some drug addict just trying to \"loiter\" around ! Is that what I look like or something? It hurts my feelings and makes me want to just kill myself because I can't take it anymore. Even when I \"passed\" as a beautiful person people in high school still made fun of me and I still percived myselr as ugly when I looked in the mirror. God someone please help me. I miss the respect that comes with looking \"beautiful\" but I am 22 now and I don't know how to look \"beautiful\" anymore. I don't have the personality of a \"beautiful\" or \"hot\" girl. I'm akward. I'm nerdy. I'm into anime. I'm into alternative and punk stuff. I had an emo myspace scene girl phase okay? So the \"I'm not like other girls\" stereotype fits me pretty well because I have always felt like nothing I ever did was good enough or cool enough to fit into any niche. The only niche I ever thought I deserved was the one that resulted in me committing suicide for the better of humanity. I really really really never ever felt like I fit in anywhere (except a medical marijuana dispensary haha) and it hurts my feelings. It makes me wanna kill myself a lot. I have my reasons. I have WAYYYYY more reasons than what I listed here, this was just barely the tip of the ice burg. lmfao\ud83d\ude02 it's just being treated like shit for being ugly in public today made me feel suicidal and depressed as fuck because I am a mentally ill sensitive as fuck baby over here. I know I should \"toughen up\" but I just can't which is a major reason why I want to end my life.  As much as I wish I could be beautiful, I could never have their shitty personality if that's what it takes to be considered \"cool\" or \"normal\" or \"attractive\". I would much rather just stay home and watch anime and smoke weed than interact with people because people are so mean and judgmental to me. It makes me feel like existing while ugly in general is still a crime and it's not. I want people to just fuck off and stop being judgmental assholes. :/ I want to be able to go out in public and not worry about what other people think of me. I wish people didn't treat me like shit because of what I look like. Even if I was pretty people would still possibly be mean to me and it's not okay with me. I JUST can't take this world anymore and the people and how mean everyone is... I want to end me so bad. :/ but I am hanging in there. Venting online has helped a lot. Thank you guys for listening to my long rant. I needed to let out my pain. I'll try to work on my self esteem and maintaining a dgaf attitude but it's hard. I am a senstive person and it's hard for me to just get over things. I feel depressed rn and it's gonna take a while before I feel happy again. I wish I was good enough and pretty enough and felt confident enough to go outside &amp; not take things personally. Anyways, if anyone else feels this way or has ever expereinced shit like this, please feel  free to comment. I think the world isn't fair to us \"ugly people\" . Sometimes I feel like they act like us existing while ugly or existing while mentally or physically disabled is a nuisance to them! I would love to not feel as alone in this pain. It was hard for me to even share this story because I feel like I am complaining but I needed to get this pain off my chest.

I get so nervous out in public that it's hard for me to make eye contact with people and talk to them. I wasn't always this way. I used to actually be the lead role in plays at my school so I was much more out going and confident in the past. After I survived an armed robbery at my work it made me develop ptsd and I haven't been the same since. I've been more anxoius and more self aware of what I look like to other people. I think I fear looking like an easy target because I don't want another person to pull a gun on me because I look easy to rob or something. I try not to over think these types of things, but I feel like I over think things like this all the time without realizing it. I over think myself too. I don't see myself as beautiful but you telling me that I am because I care about other people means the world to me. I thought having a caring heart or being empathetic was considered unattractive to people or weak. But I've always felt that my strength comes from my ability to forgive and love people. I want to think that my ability to do that makes me a beautiful person and a good person but I just don't know. Hearing an outside opinion always helps and for some reason, your opinion really brightened up my mood. Thank you for being so kind to me by commenting at all. I'm sorry this is long and that I talk a lot. (I tend to over share too much due to my ptsd. My bad!) But I really appreciate you giving a fuck about a random person like me online. It means more than you know (and more to me than I thought it would!) I didn't think I would get such a positive comment. It means a lot. Thank you. Truly.  I agree with you that true beauty comes from within and that being a good person who does the right thing is far better than being a \"beautiful\" person that's shallow, superficial or materialistic.  Thanks again for commenting to me. :)",
                "Your right. Which is why I've been doing more yard work and less playing around with make up in the mirror. I just realized yesterday that most of my make up actually expired because I barely use it any more. I just figured that the time that I spent in front of the mirror trying to be beautiful enough could be spent better because no matter what I do or how long I spend putting on make up, I can still look in the mirror and hate myself and think that I am ugly so what is the point in even trying at all? I should use the 2 hrs it takes to get ready and use it for other things. I figured it was better to utilize that time in a more spiritually fulfilling way, such as water the yard, or plant some plants, instead of doing make up because I care a lot about the WFC &amp; global warming and I feel like the earth doesn't have time for me to be selfish with make up. It (the earth) needs me to get off my ass and help it with global warming. Putting on make up doesn't make me feel better about myself nearly as much as helping the enviorment does. It's much more rewarding to help the earth to me. Which is why I am trying to be okay with letting that stuff go. Even though I like make up, there's work that needs to be done and somebody has to do it. If everyone is busy sitting looking at their phone or putting on make up, then who has the time to help save this world? We only have 12 years left ...well, now 11 according to science to fix global warming or we are all fucked. I'd rather try and help than continue to directly contribute to the problem.",

                "Even though I am depressed and suicidal af some days because I don't think I can make it in life, your comments are really encouraging me to keep going because you see shit in me rn that I can't see in myself when I am this sad. Knowing that at least to you, I'm not a bad person really means a lot to me. A lot of days I feel like I am a \"bad person that doesn't deserve to live\" because I waste away having panic attacks and anxiety all the time and it just makes me feel like the world would be better off without me in it. I definitely have \"survivor's guilt\" for suriving the robbery because I begged the guys pointing the gun at me to spare my life. I really thought I was going to live my life to the fullest if I survived the robbery, and when I did survive it, I ended up just developing crippling levels of ptsd and anxiety and it made me develop phobias and and a constant nausea condition, so now I feel like I am wasting my precious 2nd chance at life. I was given another chance and I am wasting it by staying inside all the time hiding away throwing up from fear at least once a day, because I am too afraid to go outside to do things anymore. I even dropped out of my cosmetology school because I couldn't stop throwing up randomly at the school due to fear. I just always worry now that some guy with a gun is gonna rob me and kill me so I have a hard time going outside to do anything, even grocery shop. When it comes to getting my weed, I literally try to have it delivered now because I have too much anxiety to even be seen outside. I over think everything now and it's annoying because I just want to be able to live life again and be at peace again but matter what I do I am always tense from anxiety and I can't seem to calm down. Being limited like this, makes me want to end my life a lot. Also, the survivor's guilt does too, because I feel like the armed robbery guy's should have killed me that night while they were pointing the gun at me to rob my place of work. Even though I am depressed I begged for my shitty life to be spared and I just feel like now I'm wasting my chance. Other people who survive this shit wouldn't be too scared to go outside like me. But I survived and instead of being grateful to be alive I am still depressed and my conidtions of anxiery and depression and ptsd just make me want to end myself even more. It just makes me feel bad for surviving at all when I am unable to function like how I used to. The suvivor's guult at times makes me wish I was dead.  Talking to people lile you help me break free from this mental cycle and feel grateful for my life and for the ability to be heard finally. (I never tell anybody this stuff) so finally being able to let this all out and be heard and not made fun of means a lot to me. I'm very grateful for you commenting. It's put life in perspective for me and made me realize even though I think I don't deserve to be here because of my ptsd, I could tell my story to help other people out there that feel like I do and give them hope. I really want to use my life to make a poistive difference before I die. Even though people can be really scary and mean and total assholes, I want to share my story and do what I can to help people because I don't want to say that I suffered for nothing. If I could take the pain that I feel from surviving a robbery and hs bullying and abuse from my parents, and use it to help other people, it might make me feel like my shitty life is still worth living because at least I am making a difference for people.  You see me as a good person. I see me as a broken person that's been glued back together, but I agree with you that maybe I'm not as bad as I thought. Maybe the world does still have room for a broken jar. Maybe the world needs someone like me to help it, despite my brokenness. :') I didn't know me replying to you would make you feel better. Knowing that makes me really happy. :')  I want to do more to help! I want to get help for myself so that I am stable enough to help other people too! Because helping others is the only thing I know that really works to make me feel better when it comes to my depression. Helping people and helping the earth or nature when you're feeling down is far more rewarding than bringing everyone down to your level when you're feeling down. I would much rather be productive than tear people apart. It's hard being this way. Some days I feel like giving up. But as long as I am able to help at least one person, then I am going to try to hang in there despite my depression, because that's proof that at least my life has at least some meaning to it. If I really am a \"good person\" then I will try to help out more instead of hide because the world needs my help. The world needs you too. I'm glad we have eachother in this dark time. In the past, I never would have spoke out on reddit. But mental health issues have gotten the better of me recently, so I have been much more chatty on here. It means a lot to me that you actually want to hear this stuff and that it's not a burden on you. You being accepting of me despite my weirdness is helping me to accept myself more. Your little comment has left a positive impact on my life. I'm going to try to remember what you said the next time I feel suicidal. I'm going to try and hang in there because the world needs more nice people in it. I can't let the assholes of the world make me kill myself because then they will feel like they have won and there will be more assholes than nice people left in the world. (I already feel like we are at that point tbh) so nice people are becoming rarer and rarer to find. :'( We can't let the nice ppl hide or kill themselves. We need them in this world to show and inspire others how to behave in a positive way! It's hard because people are such assholes it makes me want to hide away forever. But no good change comes to the world from people that hide away. It's the one's out there risking their lives that make history.",

                "Hiii, \n\nI wish I could have answered your comment earlier but I was at work. \n\nI hope you are doing okay. \n\nI know we barely know each other and this sounds like a weird thing to say to a stranger, but I have been constantly waking up at night lately because of nightmares, and since I read your previous comment, that suddenly stopped. It really feels good to hear from you, knowing that you still hang in there fighting depression and never give up. \n\nWhat you had to go through is none of your fault, and you never deserved it. I hate the reality that many good people out there have to suffer this cruel, vicious world although they had to try their asses off to be nice to it. \n\nI'm sorry for what you had to suffer, you don't own this world shit, you weren't granted the second chance to live, it was the fucking horrible world almost took your first chance. It was ugly like that, cold like that and I'm afraid it will always be. \n\nBut you have a warm heart, stick with it, because there are good people out there need it, you need it. I have never been pointed a gun at, but I know it's terrible, no one should be allowed to do that to anyone. I also know it's hard to get over it, but I hope you can stay strong, and eventually defeat your fear.\n\nYou want to do it or not, I'll always root for you. I wish I can offer a hug in person right now, but sadly I can't. I have learned to live on my own for so long, I feel like I forget that all of us need a hug sometimes, and I am not an exception. \n\nSo hang in there, keep fighting it. This world needs you, even a stranger like me needs you too. Keeping hoping, because hope is the best thing we can do, sometimes it's the only thing we can do, so don't stop doing that, please. \n\nI wish you all the best. \n\nHave a nice day, kind stranger.  :)"

I hate life and I hate being alive. I used to take comfort in the fact that suicide was always a last resort option for me, but now I can\u2019t. My older died in a car crash a month ago and I\u2019m my parent\u2019s only child left. I\u2019m only 16, a 16 year old shouldn\u2019t be this way. I shouldn\u2019t be such a wreck, I shouldn\u2019t need pills that help me just barely function and get me through life. My sister was my best (and for a while, only) friend, I feel like I can\u2019t live on without her. I have to though, my parents pretty much depend on me and need me. Now the school year is ending, and I have so many things to finish and make up because I was gone for two weeks. The stress of school with everything going on in life is too much. I just want to swallow my entire bottle of pills, or find a nice tall building to jump off of, or just die while I sleep. I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a while now, but it\u2019s never been quite like this. I still put up a happy front for my friends because I don\u2019t want them to worry about me, although sometimes I crack. They\u2019re supportive and everything, but I still feel empty. I still feel like I have nobody because even though they do their best, they don\u2019t want to deal with me. They\u2019re done with me and I can tell. I\u2019ve never fit with my friend group anyway. I have nobody right now. I don\u2019t like talking to my parents because I don\u2019t want them to worry about me.

I have such a void inside and no matter how badly I want to fill it, I\u2019ll always be empty. The only reasons I haven\u2019t killed myself yet is because 1. I\u2019m too much of a coward and 2. My parents need me and I feel selfish for wanting to die. I just want the universe to take me though, my life is shit. Complete and utter shit.

I'm alot older then you but I have had a hard miserable life.I also want to commit suicide and have had many attempts\nI understand your pain.  Mental pain consumes the whole body. You have to force  yourself to get  out of bed and move. I'm starting taking baby steps. I take just  little walks only for 5 minutes and sometimes in the 5 minutes I look around at the surroundings and forget for a few minutes\nYou will have good  times again I promise.

If you unsuccessfully try suicide they will put you in a psychiatric hospital with wackos who scream all night so you can't sleep, and won't let you off the unit to eat in the dining room.  Some places don't have doors in your room or bathroom so you can be watched.  If your parents don't  have good medical insurance they will put you in a state hospital.

I know so many people say that, but for me it\u2019s really the truth. Every time I want to hangout with them, it always has to be me to initiate it. If I don\u2019t say anything, I\u2019m not invited. When I attempted suicide no one tried reaching out. Today is my birthday and only my family members have called/text. I know I should be grateful that I have at least my boyfriend and family, but it still hurts seeing everyone around me hanging out and having fun while my only friend is my boyfriend. I thought I had made friends, but they only text me when they want to rant to me about their problems. They know I have issues with mental health but it\u2019s like no one gives a fuck. I sound so selfish but I\u2019m 19 and friends are supposed to surround your life. My boyfriend told me to reach out and plan something with my \u201cfriends\u201d for my bday, but I realized like why should I be the one? Aren\u2019t they supposed to make the plans?? I just wish I had one friend. One friend who only reaches out when they need something. The only reason I have given up is because I don\u2019t want to cause even more stress for my family and boyfriend. But at this point I\u2019m just prolonging the inevitable. Does anyone else have this problem? How do you accept/handle it?\n(Btw I do go to therapy and I have a psychiatrist)",
            "answer": [
                "Instead of accepting this, it sounds like you need to start cutting these \"\"friends\"\" out of your life. If they only hit you up to rant, just don't plan stuff with them. Stop responding to them, just like they don't respond to you. \n\nIn the meantime, search for new friends, new people you can hang out with and feel APPRECIATED. Build new relationships that will actually help you, instead of accepting that the current ones aren't working.\n\nI know this all sounds tough, and it'll probably take time; don't rush yourself with it. Talk it over with your psychiatrist as well, so as to get through the idea of cutting those people out of your life and putting yourself out there to meet new people. Talk to your boyfriend about it if you want to as well.",

            "question": "I've had severe depression for over 2 years, depression and Rei obsession started around December 2016. I also have severe anxiety and high functioning autism.\n\nDepression started due to mainly loneliness and not being able to be with the perfect waifu Rei Ayanami who I'd just discovered at the time. I love Rei so much and I'd do anything to be with her. She's simply perfect for me. She was one of the main causes of my depression, not being able to be with her. but there were other factors which caused my depression over 2 years ago. I've been deathly obsessed with Rei ever since I got my depression, and being suicidal over her and other things countless times, even since I got my depression.\n\nI'll explain how I found Rei. it's a bit lewd so ignore it if you wish. Found a lewd meme of Rei which was just high detail plugsuit art of her and I thought she was cute and hot, which then led me to eventually finding the Rei subreddit out of interest and also Discord server which I helped make (Which both soon completely betrayed me like a year later since they found out I'd never watched Evangelion.) then very shortly after, I became deathly obsessed and even planned to end it all for her back then, which was also one of my closest times I've been to attempting suicide.\n\nAnd I did mention I've never even watched Evangelion, and I'll explain why. I'm deathly afraid of it, though I'm fine with a few like art and stuff, aka stuff I'm already used to. The unsafe stuff though gives me extreme anxiety attacks and makes me cry instantly. I also cry randomly whenever I think of Rei or not at all. (When I cry over Rei it's over my love for her.) The reasons why I'm deathly afraid of Evangelion are being scared I'll have my vision of Rei ruined/destroyed, that she or any other character gets hurt or is in emotional pain or anything which I know happens, that Asuka will simply give me stress attacks as tsunderes cause that for me and Iknow enough to know that Asuka is a very abusive tsundere, and any emotional or intense part such as the music for example. Those are my reasons.\n\nBefore you say anything, yes I did try to watch it around the 1st of March, and over these 2+ years already before I tried, I already had a fair bit of knowledge about Evangelion. Now I'll explain my attempt at watching it after all this time back in March. I was watching it with 3 other people from Discord who I trusted who supported me all the way through and let me go at my own pace. I had to pause so much because there were so many times where I was just really affected or nervous or scared, that I had to pause. It was hell for me. There were a lot of parts which hurt me a LOT, such as Shinji's breakdown over not wanting to pilot. The final straw was when Rei first appeared on the strecher and I just had to quit, I couldn't take it anymore and I 100% didn't want to see Rei in pain 1 bit. After I quit, I needed a few days to recover but it didn't help when the Rei server owner abused me yet again and banned me again for not watching enough of it even though he made a deal that if I tried to watch Evangelion, he'd let me go. Anyway, ever since then, I never want to try and watch Evangelion again. The attempt hurt me so much. \n\nBack to my depression, I've tried antidepressants, even moving up a dose, and I have also had multiple therapists, all of this at the same time for a while, all useless. So ever since then, ages ago, I've given up hope and tried to just live with everything. Gave up around like October 2018?\n\nI don't even know what to do anymore, and I don't really want to live the rest of my life like this, but it seems I have no option anyway.",

            "question": "Hi, my heart has been feeling swollen ever since I accidentally broke my right ankle. My dream was becoming a police officer, someone who could serve my country and help people in needs. But, since becoming a police officer need to become eligible with all the requirements, so now I feel like making another dream as a reality is really hard for me to reach, but I don't that it's impossible though, it's so hard. I eager to meet a psychiatrist in my country, but I am still a student, I cannot afford to meet them for only 55 minutes for $80. Plus, I don't want my family to know since I know that they're going to ignore the pain that I have been feeling since 22nd September 2014. For 9 months I was dying from embarrassment walking with my butts going upstairs (I live in flat house, there's no elevator &amp; I am a girl), through that 9 months I've gone through humiliations from fake friends and teachers who couldn't be in a heat for a second which she made a statement sarcastically  (right after the school knew about my problem, they moved all of us to the first floor in the classroom with a broken aircond) and that hurt me so badly. I thought that I am becoming okay, but it turns out that my heart worsening. Even though, my friends ever said to me that everything's gonna be okay, but their words just couldn't heal the way I'm feeling. Yes, I've been trying to ignore it for about 4 years after the incident, but now I don't think I could anymore. I also thought that I can finally feel really happy like I used to, but now I feels like crying everyday. To be frankly speaking, I am holding onto dear life because of my parents. If not because of my parents, I think I have committed suicide. You see, I have 6 siblings including me, but they all went away and leaving us three, which means that I am now is becoming the head of the family to take care of my parents. To do that, I need a stable job and an assured future. Now I'm still studying in college and the students there are worsening my situation, that I just have to held it in because I am a loner. I didn't even commit anything wrong but I don't know why are they hating me.. I guess young people nowadays are all of that bitchy type that hurting other people's feelings. Sometimes, I wish I was a boy, so that I can just work in the store to make a living and take care of my parents. By the way, my parents is not helping either because they thought I'm just a daughter with a ridiculous excuse (I ever brought about my situation before but they think I'm crazy and here I am, contemplating whether I should live by their desires or I should just fly away and do whatever I want. But then, if I leave them, who's gonna take care of them? My heart is just turn soft when it comes to family, but it's hurting so much that my family never want to understand me. They are so selfish) and now, I become even more stressful. Thinking that, what if I couldn't make it? What I couldn't get a fine job? What if I couldn't travel (I have never travel to any country before except for neighbour country), what if I couldn't buy my own house? What if I couldn't make it out of college? What will happen to me and my parents? What if I'll never get married? And even if I do, what if my husband leave me? There's so many questions and fears in my mind and heart, I feel the world is so big for a small girl like me. I have so many other fears, maybe because my parents always scares me, example like, don't try to study abroad, there's a lot of bad people who's gonna hurt you, or don't go hanging out with your friends, they're going to destroy you by feeding you drugs, or don't date any guy, or they will rape you.. and here I am, wondering what have I been doing with my own life? I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that.. then what am I suppose to be doing? Ugh, it feels so frustrated, okay!! I need help, really. Help me.

Throughout this entire time my family as well was disappointed in me, I was quite literally a loser, bad grades, no friends, no SO, nothing. it wasn't until I was 18 that I met people I could really call friends, which is honestly all I had for a while. I had a SO during my first year of college, and because she made me happy, I feared my depression would return so I fear her leaving every day, then I find out I'm moving to another state, which them meant id either have to make long distance work or end the relationship, then came the news that I was failing my classes, and soon after my gf and I broke up for other reasons, ironically that day I was going to tell her I was moving, but I was shook by the breakup that nothing else came to mind, my final grades came in and I failed three of five classes, so here I am hanging on by a strand, with nothing left. I decided that now that I had nothing, I was going to use this move to make something out of myself, so I picked up new habits, got rid of old habits, and those friends I met at 18 years old, we're all still really close even after I moved, they still talk to me and some have even come visit me, them my grades made a huge improvement when I started at the new school, and now I'm a year away from graduating college with a 3.0 gpa. I understand that things are hard for you right now, but if I, some kid from nowhere who was the definition of a loser, could turn his life around, I believe anyone can, after all, we are still alive so theres still time to turn things around"

One bite at a time. \n\nPlan out some small steps that will put you in the direction you want to head towards. Make sure that first step is manageable. Reward yourself when you achieve a step. Above all, be patient with yourself. This will not be fixed overnight. \n\nMore specific to panic attacks: understand that your body is responding to your mind in flight/fight/freeze. I like to think of it as your monkey brain. Deep belly breathing with one hand on your belly will calm you down. Being in panic mode for extended period of time takes its toll on your body and mind. I find regular aerobic exercise reduces the intensity and duration of the panic attacks considerably. Good luck on your journey :)",

                "During times that I have been suicidal I have dropped hints like this to friends.

So for example, there was a conversation about medications, and I casually mentioned that I know exactly how much of each one in my cabinet was a lethal dose.  Friends who weren't willing to help (most) would gloss over it and move on with whatever the other topic was. Friends who were willing to help (very few) would put an abrupt halt to the conversation and make me talk about how I was feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you want to be the friend that helps, talk to him directly about your worries. Don't avoid making the conversation uncomfortable. Don't let side comments pass without being called out and confronted. If he has social anxiety, then he will never make the first move to hang out, so make a point of inviting him out or inviting yourself over to his place to hang out with him.",

Instead make sure you regularly reach out to him and just chat about life, get together and do things, be the instigator of conversations and outings.  It can make a difference. \n\nThe reality is most \"friends\" walk away from depressed people, sometimes because they perceive the person closing down as not wanting them there (false).  The depressed person can end up alone and that just spirals them deeper.  It's harder to kill yourself if you have friends you KNOW care."

I had this girlfriend at the time and she helped me through that and was the only one there for me like I did for her a few years before when she was put in foster care. We\u2019ve talked each other out of suicide a couple times. I eventually pushed her away and kind of went off the deep end. I\u2019ve thought about killing myself so many times over the past 3 years, came very very close last year. I even wrote 3 suicide notes and left my house with a very sharp knife and was gonna call 911 when I was away from my home and then cut my wrists so my family wouldn\u2019t find my body. I got a strangely timed text right before I was about to do it and decided to not do it that night. No body besides one person knows about that and no one even knows I was/am that depressed. I hated my life so much I had nothing to be happy for I was 310 lbs and an asshole. I eventually got myself to get my shit together slowly. I\u2019ve lost 70 lbs and I\u2019ve been trying my best to be a better person and help people when I can. I\u2019ve been better these past couple of months but my ex gf came back into my life 3 months ago basically divorced and with a baby. We\u2019ve been talking a lot almost every day for these few months (like 8 hours on the phone isn\u2019t uncommon) and it\u2019s been nice but terrible at the same time. She keeps giving me these mixed signals that she still has feelings for me and what not but it\u2019s probably just cause she\u2019s lonely from the divorce. I\u2019m a Virgin and she one night offered to take my virginity. I declined because like I mentioned I thought she was just feeling lonely and I didn\u2019t want to take advantage of that. Days later she confirmed that\u2019s why she asked. It\u2019s killing me cause I love her and I want to be with her but I also don\u2019t think I could handle being used then thrown away when she realizes I\u2019m just a short term answer to her problems. I\u2019ve known her for 10 years now but haven\u2019t talked to her in like 1 year and change until now and she\u2019s still the only person I\u2019ve ever enjoyed talking to or am willing to talk to about very personal things. She helps me keep my shit together most of the time and makes me happy. Like a lot happier than anyone else can make me but at the same time I feel like shit cause I love her and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll ever feel that way towards me again. I just don\u2019t know if I should try to distance myself from her or keep her in my life since she\u2019s basically my only true friend at this point and the only person who I can usually turn to if there\u2019s no one else unless it\u2019s about her.",

But, I know if I look past all my minuscule issues there is something more. Like for instance, I will sometimes think to myself about how enormous the universe is and how many stars there are. And throughout this entire universe that is trillions to zillions of lightyears big and possibly never ending. I somehow exist. So after this about this, I have to conclude that yes life has meaning and that yes death is meaningful as well.

Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.

Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I \"must always have been a secret narcissist\".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.

I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said \"its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again\" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.

                "The depression detaches us from realities. The \"you\" that was your successful self is still there. You have the same brain that achieved all that. \n\nWhat has changed is that your head has slipped into a habit of over-processing and ovsessiving about the negative. We depressive have problems because of the way our heads process stimulus, not because of some crazy dumbing-down \"brain rot\". \n\nThe old part of our brain has a place called the limbic system. The LS is heavily involved in our emotional response. I have never figured out why the LS has such a command of language, but it come up with Automatic Negative Thoughts (ANTs) that we perecieve in the form of our brains being completely hijacked by hearing rentless things such as \"I'm a loser\" \"I am worthless\" \" I'd do the world a favor by just being dead\" yadda, yadda, yadda... That's the work of the LS. \n\nWhat happens in this horrible, soul-killing barrage is that our prefrontal cortex (the logic center, just behind the eyebrows) tries desparately to counter the ANTs. The PFC detects the ANTs and we percieve the ANTs like a voice of authority in our heads. The ANTs are are real as the math your 3rd grade teacher taught- to our psyche. The problem is, that the ANTs are complete fabrication and the PFC goes on a wild goosechase trying to are against them. But the PFC is pussing in the wind. If the ANT says \"I'm a loser\", the PFC gets caught up in a losing argument. There is no defination of \" a loser\". \"Loser\" is a taunt, not a real state of being. You can't make a single, iviversal defination of \"loser\" in the way you could define \"CEO\" or \"dean\". Defining \"loser\" is like defining the exact shape of a water drop. You can't. And neither can your PFC. But it tries. And tries. And tries. \n\nAnd befor you know it, the PFC that you used to run your past life is mainly preoccupied with dealing with the drivel the ANTs throw out. Ya, no, you can't get your old life back without your PFC focusing on the realities of real life- your job and it's complexities, your social life, being a dad. \n\nSO, what do you do about all this confrontaion between the ANTs and the PFC? \n\nStop the ANTs. It's like getting 2 old, bickering married people to quit with that old  roleplay and really get some life lived. \n\nI went through about 7 therapists and 3 Rx's and still had the same depression of 37 years. \n\nI won't tell you what to do, but I will tell you what I did. \n\nI identified that I needed to control the ANTs. They were crippling me, hobbling me, holding me back from living and being productive. (Via many ways).\n\nI felt like I had ZERO control over anything, really- not my in my ability to earn money, my finances, my kids, my household, traffic, nit even in contol of what was goi g on in my own head. \n\nSo, I deduced that creating some control in my life would, at the very least, serve to counter the feeling that nothing else was in my control. \n\nAnd I had little time to myself (overbearing, controling now ex spouse) and no money, of course. \n\nSo I created a little world for myself I called \"the power trip\". I had an old pair of running shoes. I'd go out for a jog alone. And I created an experience of COMPLETE CONTROL. \n\nI'd get out of earshot of the ex and start. I'd say OUT LOUD somthin like \"I am in control of running 3 sreps on the right side of the sidewalk\", and do it immediately.  \"I am in control of taking 2 deep breaths in a row\". \"I am in control of pushing my left sleeve half way up my arm\". \"I am in control of... \" you get the idea. I said it out loud because I that THAT much trouble otherwise escaping the ANTs. But during the full mind and body immersion od a power trip, my head did not have the capacity to speak, act and be creative for the next little control task to acknowledge any ANTs. I made time for my power trip about 5 of 7 days per week. About 20 minutes at a time. If I couldn't jog, I walked. \n\nIt worked. But in ways I never had anticipated. Sure I got a little break form my ANTs+my personal grade A anxiety. \n\nWhat also happens is that my PFC stopped playing it's stupid games with the ANTs. It's like my PFC stopped tolerating them. My PFC called their BS. \n\nAnd then the ANTs stopped. \n\nMy PFC is now free from dealig with the stupid Automatic Negative Thoughts endlessly spring from my Limbic System. I have the freedom to use my PFC as I chose again. Oddly enough, with the computing power of my prefrontal cortex in my control, my life is a millon times better than what it ever was as a depressive. \n\nMaybe my story will help you.

This is not me shrugging to your situation, because I know how it can come off from people who don\u2019t know, but I have suffered from depression most of my life, so I get it. Most of the time after a dark episode, I always realize my own mind is what\u2019s making everything so awful. I\u2019m not being mindful and I\u2019ve paused from living in the moment. People such as friends and fam often come across as not caring when really they do, they might just have their own crap going on that they are learning to emotionally handle, and they aren\u2019t being there because they don\u2019t even realize their own selfish behaviors and by default people are just naturally super selfish, not that that that justifies it or anything. But depression is like a huge toxic stain in your mind that blocks your clear view of things. We ourselves can be our own worst enemies. I honestly recommend, maybe when you find a job\nthat you like that offers insurance and benefits, you can find a therapist or even now there are things I\u2019ve heard of that work well like TalkSpace which is therapy on your phone where you kinda like FaceTime or something with a professional, or so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told what it\u2019s like. I\u2019m not sure if the price of that, but with whatever you choose I really think if you found the right type of therapist for you, and it has taken me a few therapists to find the right one for myself, but I love her and I know I can always go to her for that type of support and for the guidance and tools they can help lift yourself out of the dark rut you\u2019re in right now. I\u2019ve been where you are, and I promise it really helps but you have to do it on a consistent healthy basis. It\u2019s just baby steps and being patient with yourself, and also being gentle with yourself and rewarding yourself for even making it out of bed when you feel this way. That really is a difficult task when you\u2019re feeling like you don\u2019t want to exist, but not reeeeeally be dead at the same time. You just don\u2019t want to feel the pain anymore. It takes time but you can do it. Some days might be worse than others and for a moment you may feel defeated but just remember there are people who care and who are thinking of you and wishing you the best.

                "Keep at it. Your depression, like mine, was years and years in the making and reinforcing. \n\nThe strategy I took is unique. After about decade of outside help, I asked myself, \"Doing what I am doing, am I getting the results I want to get?\" \n\n(At this point in my life I was barely making money, catering to every whim of an ogre narcissist, and on the verge of failing to pay my bills and rent, and would lose custody of my kids with no residence. My kids were no the ogre's kids. The ogre almost dumped me of at an ER to be commited for a sucidal breakdown once already, but chickened out because he wouldn't get access to my child support money any more.)\n\nThe medicine made me feel jitter and jumpy and caused a racing heart at \"regular doses\", so i was reduced to a bare minimun dose, so I don't think the drug manage my depression much. \n\nTherapy was a place I went to and he or she let me talk. I felt like 95% of the therapy was what I would say to the mirror after reading a self-help article of Better Homes and Gardens. \n\nI have a BA in psychology. I decided to add real beain science to my anti-depression crusade. \n\nI experienced my depression setting up camp in my brain as a 7 year old child, with a fairly simple life of school, a pet hermit crab, and little else. No friends a single toddler sibling , and hand-off, detachment parents. \n\nI remember distinctly the Automatic Negative Thoughts coming from the back/rear of my head. The part of my head the tried in vein to counter the ANTs was the front part, the Prefrontal Cortex, as I much later learned. \n\nThe back and front were at war. Every night, I'd sob in seething pain of hating to be alive and in shame and seering guilt of feeling the way I felt. I hid it from my parents, although it was not hard. \n\nMy mental picture of it all was like that of the \"Last Judgement\" with the horrors of hell at the bottom and the goodness of Jesus and heven up top, like the back/bottom of my head and front/top of my head. \n\nFast forward to my mid 40's and being on the bring of committed to an institution. \n\nI knew from my experience as a child, that the depression had a source in the brain. I looked at brain anatomy and best I can I dentify, it is from the area of the Limbic System and Dorsal Raphe Nucleus. (LS and DRN) \n\nIt was like the LS has a megaphone in my head and the PFC wispered. Or, as if in the war in my head, the LS had rocket laungers and M80's  and the PFC had bb guns. TOTAL IMBALANCE.\n\nSo, as I explained, I sought out to balance the volume of the LS and PFC. \n\nFrom my classes in college, I k ew about neurons, a bit about how they fire in sequence and wire together and how \"muscle memory\" can trigger reflexive firing, luke when we tire our shoes. With repetition, executing the action of tying our shoes does not require the step-by-step thought process.\n\nTurns out, it takes a certain number of hours of specific practice to get a certain chain of neuron to wire together. I. 10 hours, you have a pretty good wiring, and with thousands of hours you are considered a \"professional\" or a \" master\" at something. Well, guess how many hours in our lifetime we have spent \"mastering\" our depression? Especially in relation to hours spent on a specific depression counter-measure. It's numbers. 5, 6, 7 hours is nothing to judge success by when I know my brain has been actively supporting its own depressive habits for THOUSANDS of hours since I was 7 years old. \n\nSo, I took the approach of training like an athlete trains for an upcoming sports season. \n\nSuppose would- be soccer player \"Chris\" gets some shin guards and soccer shoes, reads up a bit on soccer rules, and practices moves 45 minutes per week in the 6 weeks preceding the first game.\n\nSuppose would-be soccer player \"Pat\" gets some shin guards, shoes and learns the rules also, but practices every single day. Time spent learning to dribble the ball up and down the field, defend around oponent, headiing an incoming ball, etc. If \"Pat's\" total minutes of specific practice on repeating a single move of maneuvering the ball around a cone in practice is a total of 15 minutes a day, times 4 days a week time 6 weeks of pre-season, Pat has accumulated 6 hous of specific practice on that maneuver.\n\nWho is going to be more ready to perform as a soccer player at the first game?? \n\n(The analogy is that I am the would-be soccer player and the 1st game is an looming depressive episode.)\n\nWhat I had to to was bring elements of purely OBJECTIVE reality into my anti-depressive crusade. \"X\" number of minutes doing my \"in control\" exercise was one of those objective elements.\n\nNothing from my verious therapists was ever that kind of specific. It was always \"well, how do you feel after.... \" \"how do you feel since...\" \"how are you feeling....\"  Newsflash: reporting a \"feeling\" is completey subjective. \n\nI needed balance in subjective and objective. Not all or nothing, just some of each. \n\nIt turns out, that is the key to overcomi g depression, too. Balance between the volume and authority of the various areas of our brains.",

I didn't get much help here before and I really wish more people would come out and just talk to me about what can be done. I'll be continuing from my last post (though it's quite long) so it would really help me if you read that too. Thanks in advance!\n\nSo I'm back home after so long and I got adjusted real soon as well as started studying for good this time. Everything went quite great for almost 2 months without medications and without even discussing anything with anyone.......until now!!\nI was losing focus and pace of my studies for the past week and I don't know whether it was already my depression coming back or was I just tired of my studies and that is what brought it (the depression) back BUT it did come back and this time it felt really goddamn terrible.\n\nSo my grandfather has Alzheimer's and obviously it's not his fault at all, but we all being humans, my family get pretty much irritated by him all the time, not only because of his memory but he also hallucinates a lot. Yesterday I don't know what got into my head but when he started irritating us (not intentionally obviously I knew that), I hit him. I hit him pretty hard and that too couple of times. Even though he begged for mercy I kept doing that. My father wasn't there and my mother was probably terrified. So it just kept happening till he gave his word he would stop talking non sense and made him sign a paper stating so. Even though I knew he'd forget that too.\nDuring all of this I got pretty emo and I told my mother about my depression. She wasn't too shocked as she always knew something was definitely wrong with me. After things calmed down and I apologised to my grandpa (even though he didn't remember what happened), I sat with my mom and she told me something!\nWhile I was thinking that everything was going pretty fine when I was far from home I just got to know that things didn't change much.\nMum and dad used to fight and shit had gone bad atleast once. It was then when she realised that she might be having depression. But she let everything go away and both my parents somehow continued there life trying to find happiness as we all are!\nWhen papa came home I told him about my depression too because I thought it's better late than never (though I didn't tell him about the physical torture I did to my grandpa). He said it's probably nothing and instead of seeking drugs I should \"just try to calm my mind\". I also requested him to take grandpa to his doctor as it had been a while and his mental health was degrading day by day. Also requested both of my parents to have a routine check up with their doctors as they both suffer from diabetes as well as hypertension too.\nSo this was day 1.\n\nNow today, same thing happened fucking again. This time I first begged my grandpa to stop when he started irritating but when he didn't understand I just told my mother and grandpa that I'm gonna jump off the roof today! My grandpa didn't understand much but he knew I was talking about suicide so he asked my mother to stop me because he can't walk fast himself. But my mother even more depressed said she won't stop me if this is what I want! As I went out to do the horrible deed I heard my mother screaming real loud. That got me terrified and I walked in again to check on her.\nShe was just clenching her hairs and shouting. She was looking at my grandpa with all the anger she had. And man she was drooling \ud83d\ude2dShe screamed even harder when I held her again as if she's seen a ghost (God i wanna cry so hard). I had no idea of what to do and all of my emotions again shifted to anger towards my grandpa AND I TRIED TO STRANGLE HIM TO DEATH. I mean all I did was grab his throat hard for like 2-3 seconds but I still have all of it in my head. Just a moment later somehow (literally 10 seconds later) my grandpa said \"My tea is on my bed. I want it\" and I fucking tried to burn his head with hot tea!! My mum stopped me from that sin though. From that moment till now I'm thinking that I should be in jail. Even for life maybe. That would be better for everyone!\n\nWhen I couldn't handle it anymore I called my father and he reached home as soon as he could. He was devastated. At first he was so angry that he said he's going to kill the old man himself (even though he still didn't know fully what has happened) and he opened the belt of his pants to do so! I tried to stop him but he was so furious that I had to say that \"if he dies then I die\". And I started walking out of the house (again). He said he would kill himself instead if I walk out and I replied in frustration that he should do it!! \nI do feel crappy about me all the time but today was the worst!!\n\nAfter both me and my father trying to calm down each other for an hour or so, we both had an all day long discussion.\nI opened my heart as much as I could (though not completely) about how I felt about myself and both of my parents and he too gave me some valuable life lessons.\nAt the end we both agreed that we'll go see doctor for me as well as for regular checkups of my parents as well as my grandpa.\nI even asked them that mother should also seek advice regarding her mental health but they didn't want to risk more medications than she was already taking. So I advised them to talk to each other about anything and everything that they can and should so that basically they not become each other's therapists but also maybe a Better couple. I don't really think that any of my advice has been taken well as they were much much much more concerned about my health when I was giving them advice.\n\n\nBasically what I wanted to ask of anyone who reads this post is how to live with the images of incidents that happened today.\nMy screaming mother, the face that she had at that time, probably this is what will become of her if I ever really end my life, and how bad her mental condition has become!\nMe hitting the one person who used to walk me home everyday from school bus stand when I was small!\nAnd the face of my father when I told him to die!\nHOW CAN I LIVE WITH ANY OF THIS?\n\nI always wanted this world to be a good place for everyone but now I feel that maybe I myself is the worst thing that has ever happened to this universe!!",

I've dealt with suicidal ideation but beyond that this is all very far out of what I'd be able to help you with.\n\nMy main suggestion is to get professional help. If not for your entire family to help fix the dynamic then for yourself, to help you with your coping mechanisms.\n\nI don't think strangers on the internet can replace professional help. I think the first step of reaching out on this sub is important and I'm not diminishing that. But I think (as with most people on this subreddit myself included) professional help is the way to go. We can't provide much more than emotional support and maybe some sense of comradery. That's my opinion at least. I love this sub but I don't see it as a replacement for professional help.",

                "Okay, I'm going to be frank with you. Back in 2011 my ex and I were going to the loss of a child. During that time frame, we'd gotten burglarized and the burglar dropped an 8-inch  hunting knife outside the window. I was working overnights, getting to and from my job on foot, and walking 8 Miles everyday. (4 miles there. four miles back.) Our landlord refuse to do anything to up the security in the trailer court we were living in at the time. This left us no choice but to move and it turned into an even more disastrous situation. I got to the point where I wanted to end it and I attempted to do so. After all was said and done my attempt failed. I spent the night sleeping in an Alleyway and then later on a park bench. Found a police officer the next morning, and had them take me to the hospital where I checked myself in for mental help. I'm not slightest bit ashamed of the fact I got the help I needed. Even if it was almost too late.\n\nThere is no shame in a hospital stay especially if it's going to help you be a better person tomorrow.\n\n as far as your grandfather is concerned, perhaps it's a good idea to see if his medical insurance will allow for a home health aide to come in. if your family is vehemently against putting him in an assisted living facility, this is the next best option.\n\nWhile the nurse is there, maybe your family getting into some sort of group counseling and you getting into some sort of individual counseling especially after a hospital stay it's the best idea."

                "Don't give up on her, even when the pressure on you to support her seems tough. Simple gestures like reminding her that she's cared for, making her a meal when she has only eaten depression meals (ie. a sleeve of saltines), and given her frequent affirmations that her feelings are valid but they aren't forever really helps. Be there for her and make yourself available emotionally. Allow yourself to be her number 1 if she needs it, and just keep her distracted with things she loves, which could mean snuggles on the couch while watching her favorite show to engaging her in her hobbies even when she has a hard time being interested in them. As an example, if she loves to draw, get some pencils and a sketchbook for you too and be like let's draw together just for fun! If she's a runner, go on a run with her. She may have a hard time getting there, but the start is the hardest. Tell her how great she's doing when she is engaging in these hobbies, as oftentimes when you're depressed and you do your hobbies, you're like \"wow I fucking suck at this now, why did I even bother.\" So be like \"oh my God that drawing so cool\" or \"you're so fast I don't get how you run this long!\" even if it's only partially true or not even true at all. These are just examples since I don't know your partner's hobbies, but you get the gist. \n\nI suffer from depression and my partner has completely given up on me recently and told me \"I don't want to be your number 1.\" That is one of the worst feelings.

                "Hey there, has she had any lab evaluations to check for things like anemia (check with CBC), thyroid dysfunction (check with TSH), or vitamin D deficiency (check with Vitamin D 25-hydroxy, but be aware vitamin D can be more expensive to check than the other labs)? Does she drink plenty of water? And how's her diet? I know depression is a complex issue but these things I mentioned can play a major role in feeling well/unwell.\n\nAlso if she does get labs checked, particularly TSH, make sure she's not taking any vitamins or supplements that may contain biotin as biotin interferes with several testing methods. For example, biotin supplementation can cause the reported value for TSH to appear within normal range when the true value may be above normal (which is suggestive of hypothyroidism). \n\nAlso there are a lot of free Cognitive Behavioral Therapy exercises and apps available that may help her recognize and change negative patterns of thinking. Additionally, journaling may be beneficial for her, particularly if she can utilize CBT methods to recognize and reconstruct her negative thoughts. \n\nAnother important aspect to assess is sleep and sleep quality. Does she get enough sleep? Does she ever wake up or does she snore? Non-restful sleep caused by a sleep disorder like sleep apnea can wreck one's life if untreated. \n\nOh, another area to look into is how much time she is spending online, particularly social media. Social media can be a major trigger of anxiety and depression because 1. The most shocking stories/news are shared disproportionately which can overwhelm the viewer and 2. People tend to post the positive aspects of their lives while leaving out the negatives, which paints a false picture of \"normalcy\" and can be triggering for those suffering from self-esteem issues. \n\nIt's nice to see you're seeking out ways to support her, just remember to take care of yourself as well so that you can provide the best support you can. \n\nBlessings to you and your girlfriend!",

I have a sister (18) and a brother (15).\n\nFirst 4 years of my life were hazy. just me alone and having my babysitter care for me until she had to leave when she married someone. She was the first person i connect with and lose.\nWhen i was born one of my grandparents was dead. The other one died when i was 1 year old. I always envied people who had such close families and have relationships with their aunts and uncles and grandparents. Half of mine were senile and the other half was dead. \n\nThen My only friend was my pet bunny, my mother cooked him for a meal and i ate him without knowing because i was told he ran away. I learned about it a decade ago. I ate my own friend that i cared for. I felt sick for days physically. \n\nWhen i was 6-7 i made my first friends of my age. A guy and 2 twins. It was amazing until we have to move. i moved with my family to our own house in the countryside, it was a bad poor area. All the families that lived there were related in some way and Essentially a clan, i was the outsider kid. The \"rich\" spoiled brat. Because because they knew the parents were doctors. \n\nIt took me a year to open up to one of the guys close to my age that lived there because his parents knew mibr and he invited me to play with him and the other kids. I had a brand new football jersey and they commented on it and i was embarrassed until the game started and i was doing good. The other guy didn't like it so he threw sand in my face and i pushed him in response. Next thing i knew all the kids were beating me in defence of their relative. Some of then were older, 14 to 16. I never went back again. They hated me and labelled me the outsider since that day and i would cry in silently whenever my father sends me to buy groceries because it means I'll have to meet them and endure the bullying i have to fight multiple people. Eventually i learned to fight and i started giving back more than i receive. I developed a brutality that would aid me later on in life. \n\nI am an introverted, Not shy. I am not scared of people, i just get annoyed and tired by people's presence. I like and i enjoy my solitude while listening to music or chatting online or playing or reading a book. My parents refused to understand that its normal and my nature and thought i was antisocial and kept pressuring me to go to relatives, attend parties, meet classmates etc. It made me distance myself from them and i can't fix it now. \n\nMy father forced me to attend this martial art class. I enjoyed the fighting as it allowed me to release anger but i gates the environment. Its the same as my neighbourhood, all close and related and then there's me. Along the years i made some friends there. But it was overall hell. One incident stands out. One of the kids my age stopped me when i was walking home (around 5km walk) and demanding some money and he and his older cousins beat me but i managed to get some hits on him as well. \nYears later i would learn that he was clowning around in front of his middle school and a truck fucked him up when he got near. He is now a vegetable. Whenever i see him when the other guys meet him to give him a present or anything i just stand back and watch his fucked up retarded brain gazing around with those glassy eyee. God i am glad he didn't die. It'll be too good and fast for him. I enjoyed watching his dirty excuse of existence and the life he lived now haha. \n\nWhen i was in middle school i was forced to leave and enter school by climbing the back wall to avoid the thugs and bullies who would be around the front gate and target people who they don't recognize as parts of their \"gangs\". Bullying and fighting was as big as education in that period of life. I got jumped for money multiple times even tho i don't carry it or just bullying for the sake of it. I fought back and i gkt black eyes, i got someone literally bite a chunk of my shoulder with their teeth. I almost killed someone when i bashed their head with a rock. I almost got stabbed. I stabbed someone. Highshcool was worse in ways but better in others. I don't go into details about it. \n\nWhen i was 15 my grandfather's health started getting downhill, memory loss and delirious stuff. \nI would visit him with my father couple times every couple months and each visit he would be worse until he would not recognize me and ask who i am. \n\nWhen i was 17, i was preparing for a test when i heard that he finally kicked the bucket and died. \nI didn't even attend his funeral i just went on to my studying. \n\nI lived with my aunt and her family in the capital while i was attending certain language classes and i got a lot closer to her husband, my uncle. The only male in the family. He became another father figure to me. He helped grow in new ways. Died a year ago after his smoking addiction caught up with him. \n\nI fell in love for the first time in my life. She returned the feelings. It was perfect. She left almost a year later because she couldn't handle the distance. I was crushed and cried with my dog alone at night. \n\nWhen i was 18 my best friend admitted that he thought nothing of me behind a lucky failure that was blessed to have parents to bail him (after my very average scores in my finals) and the bridge between us broke forever. \n\nWhen i was 20 i met a friend in Poland (i am studying here as a foreign student) and he was my friend friend in a strange land and we were both foreigners in a xenophobic place since he was from the middle east and i was from north Africa) and we bonded. He was best friend and helped me through a lot. \nI wake up one day with the news that he committed suicide and dumped from a building's window. \nI couldn't even attend his funeral because i was away. \n\nDuring the same year i fell in love with a girl that returned my feelings unlike the other crush i had months before. I love this girl and we are still together. She's polish. Her family hates me. I am a filthy brown skinned scum in their mind. I already hate my nationality because i hate how limited by options are internationally since my nation is trash in the scale of things. I am not a Muslim and not religious yet everyone would assume i am because of my nationality and looks. I get stopped in airports. The distrust in public. Her parents callee her a whore for being with nr and that she better enjoys wearing a headscarf. Her mother cried and called her a disappointment. Her father called her a whore. Her grandmothers keep telling her to be wary with me. Nowadays with the family getting to know me i still see her grandmother telling her not to trust me. My self hatred is deeply rooted for my looks and nationality because i hate it end i hate all that is related to it. I am forever judged for something i don't control even tho i share nothing with my countrymen. \n\n\nMonths ago i hear that my last grandparent, my grandmother died as well and her body gave up. I am abroad so i can't argent the funeral. Wouldn't have done so even if i was there. The family connection just feels cold. \n\nDays ago i receive a message from my little brother figure. My friend that i consider my little brother more than my biological one. He is living on borrowed time before he dies from heart failure according to doctors. \n\nThe latest news made me scared. I am scared because i do not feel the same angst and heart break of the usual suffering. \n\nI feel numb. I didn't feel the same pain and anger and rage as years ago. I just feel hazy, numb, feeling with bursts of sadness, Rage, confusion. But just that. Random spikes. Otherwise just dead. Numb.\nAm i losing my feelings?

Remember, no matter what, you will be okay. \n\nOne if my favorite ways to remember this is through meditation. Anxiety puts us in a tunnel view where the world feels small and dangerous.\nMeditation can help us reset and reset our view to a bigger, safer, more gentle world. \n\nHave fun and just take it one minute, one hour, one day at a time.\n\nAll the best.",

            "question": "Hey Reddit. So my mom just passed away, I was fired from my job, my dad and siblings won't speak to me, I'm beyond broke, in what I consider to be substantial debt, I'm being evicted from my apartment and to be honest, if it wasn't for my cats I would not be alive right now. I'd say that's a decent TL:DR.\n\nFull spectrum, things began to snowball back in September of '18. I was living with my GF of almost 3 years down in TX. I'm a fine dining server and she's a corporate trainer for a restaurant. At the time, things were a bit rocky between us so she decided to go open a new store which is about a 3 week trip. The time away was much needed and long overdue, even if my 32nd birthday was only five days after she left. Just before she got back I had learned of my dad's(66y) colon cancer diagnosis and my mom(63y) being admitted to a nursing home. When I told my GF this, while sitting across the living room, she apologized awkwardly followed by a long pause. Then said \"I know it's bad timing but I need to move out. I can't do this anymore.\"\n\nNovember, a week or so later I fly up to PA with my older brother and his GF to see my ailing mother. It was very difficult to see her who, when I had last seen her a couple years back was 5'6\" and 140 lbs, was now 5'3\" and 89 lbs with her entire right side paralyzed. I flew back and things at home were just sad and awkward between my GF and I. The next day I find out that my mom had signed a DNR earlier that morning. To which I replied \"Shenanigans... She's right-handed.\" but was acknowledged with little to no avail as verbal consent suffices.\n\nDecember, the GF moves out after what felt like an anti rape demonstration you'd see at the Y or community center but with a little added strangling for emotional impact. A few days later I get diagnosed with 4 kidney stones (#144-148). I cleaned and neatly packed allllll of my exGF stuff. Some assault charges pressed but dropped. A little suicide attempted, pitifully I might add. 28 sleeping pills wasn't enough. My Dad actually acts like a Dad for a decent time. Christmas.\n\nFast forward to April of '19..\n\nApr13 - Mom falls into coma\n\nApr15 - *** given less than a week\n\nApr16 - *** given 48 hrs\n\n............- I get fired for not showing up to work after telling them that I had JUST found out.\n\nApr17 - Dad and brother, who live 30min and 5min away from me respectively, fly up to be there with her. They claim to have called from the airport... Regardless, they didn't swing by, knock on the door, call more than once, no voicemail, or anything that would indicate thought or concern about me or my well-being like if I had offed myself\n\nApr18 - Mom passes away at 4:20pm of unknown causes. Post-mortem revealed COD to be late-stage pancreatic cancer.\n\nI haven't spoken to my dad or my brother since. I didn't get another job until May 6 and didn't start making money until May 17. I have been struggling through the depression just trying to keep from falling apart but it's so fucking hard.....I feel so alone. I'm now 2 months behind on rent, I'm getting evicted, my vehicle needs a fairly good bit of maintenance and considering that the registration is out, if caught will be impounded as of June 1... Which just happened a few minutes ago.. I have three amazing cats, all rescues and, if I'm being honest here, if it wasn't for waking up to those three sweet, somewhat little furballs asleep on top of or all around me everyday, I don't think I would have the strength to get out of bed. They are the only things that seem to warm my heart anymore. I could never leave them but I don't know how much longer I'm going to last. There's a bunch more legal and financial troubles as well and I just.. I don't know what to do or where to even start... I am not okay and I need help.",

We try to stay in touch while they are away but they have their new life, new school, new job, new friends... and while they are gone I feel so incredible lonely, all day long. I\u2019m don\u2019t know how to make new friends, real friends, the kind that you can call for no reason and ask them to go for coffee or go on a hike or just whatever you can think of. I do have acquaintances, but I feel if I wouldn\u2019t initiate contact they would forget I exist. My collage reunion was a few weeks ago and nobody asked if I was going and no one asked why I didn\u2019t come, because nobody noticed I wasn\u2019t there even though I had talked to a few people a month prior about going with them. Sometimes I think nobody would notice if I disappeared for a month, not even my family because they, like everyone else, have their own life.

You have every right to be depressed and lonely. It\u2019s just a human thing to feel these emotions. You did a great job just writing these emotions down and venting though. It\u2019s not fun/healthy to bottle everything up. \n\nTry investing your free time to a volunteering organization. It doesn\u2019t seem much, but the community is a great way to make meaningful connections. It\u2019s pretty hard to connect to people nowadays (what a shocker), so sometimes we have to look outside of our workspace to meet people. Finding a hobby that has several people involved (like basketball in a local park) is a great way to make connections too. \n\nSet your expectations low and reasonable. There really is no external factor that can make you feel more happy or content with life. (Of course, it can vary per person, but personally I\u2019ve realized that the more I expect from the people around me the more lonely I become.) Life has its ups and downs, and it\u2019s just a fact. There\u2019ll be patches where it\u2019s really rough and others that are really great. The fact that you even thought to reassess your character, might be a good thing. It means you\u2019re growing from this rough patch, because if it wasn\u2019t tough you\u2019d just stay content to how you were and be inconsiderate to those around you. Use the rough patches to grow and use the great patches to look back and reflect how much you\u2019ve grown.\n\nYou might want to pick up therapy, until you have a strong support group to listen to you in your rough patches. (Meaning until you meet some really amazing people, keep doing therapy.) \n\nSomething fun to try with your suicidal thoughts. I label my suicidal thoughts and tendencies as ridiculous things and have a good laugh at it sometimes. Just yesterday I said I wanted to be a seal and then eaten by an orca. I labeled it as a big, fat mood and had a good laugh. Silly little things like this can really make your day. \n\nEnjoy the little things. Try to make sure you congratulate yourself for just taking care of yourself. Your day won\u2019t seem as hard or tough and you\u2019ll end up being a bit more positive about it. \n\nOf course, all of this is tough to do. It takes time and patience, but it\u2019s been worth it for me. I\u2019m obviously not \u201ccured\u201d but I\u2019m not emotionally dead, so I\u2019ll take that for now. Life is tough, but we got to say we\u2019re tougher. Try to drop the alcohol and replace it with a different time consuming activity. It\u2019ll help you in the long run. Best of luck.",
                "First paragraph sums it all up. For example Chester Bennington (Linkin Park ) had everything, that did not stop him from feeling lonely and depressed. \n\nAbout the friends part, its your interpretation which is at fault here. I don't think a random group of people can hate anyone in particular for no reason. I know you are trying to be as positive as possible and still think that people find you odd and discomforting but the thing is reality is more likely to be the exact opposite of what you're thinking. \n\nI've had this same experience with my friend circle but one day when I asked one my friends point blank wether it felt discomforting just being in my presence he was shocked. He was shocked that I asked this question. He told me literally the exact opposite of what you and I were thinking (about our respective friends). I honestly was so overjoyed that day and ended up crying in bed when I got back home. It's honestly on of the best days of my life. I even remember the date, the time and even what I was wearing that day.\n\n All that was wrong was my self esteem. It was not my friend's attitude that was at fault, it was depression that led me to believe so. Get out of depression first, don't fall into the negative loop of feeling bad for yourself that you have no friends. Just try and hit up a few friends and ask if they want to tag along with you next time you hot the bar. Don't feel bad if they refuse.\n\nI know that it sounds stupid, because you already know it. Don't go to the bar by yourself. But most of all just don't be alone. Going to the bar alone is probably better than just sitting at home and doing fuck all. Which what I did during my depression. \n\nTry the support group. I think it can really help. You'll meet people like yourself and myself there and you'll find a common thing to talk about.\n\nAnd stop apologizing. You really don't need to apologise if you're posting something. And relax this wasn't even a rant. It was just a socially awkward guy being honest about his everyday problems. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Its normal to feel sad/depressed but don't apologise to the world about it. \n\n**Just make sure you get professional help**",
                "What does everyone at a bar have in common? They want to drink. That's it. It's a diverse group of people, but not exactly somewhere you're going to make any kind of real connection, especially because alcohol is involved. \n\n\nGym, sorta similar thing. Everyone is there to work out. You *might* make a gym buddy if you talk to anyone there, but most people are just there to keep in shape.\n\n\nTry group fitness or more specific fitness. Like a running group or a a sport meet up you can find online. \n\n\nGroup sports are good, think basketball or something, and you could probably find games at your local YMCA or whatever your equivalent is. \n\n\nOne on one sports are also good, like MMA or boxing. Who cares if you're bad at first, people will want to help you unless that group is filled with assholes. \n\n\nYou probably won't find \"your people\" drinking or lifting weights running on treadmills or at a job. You only have one thing in common with those people, wanting to get drunk, wanting to be in shape,  and make money. \n\n\nI'm currently working on this myself right now. I realized no one I've ever talked to in a bar has ever become my friend. Just being nice to someone isn't enough to make a friend. And in my case, being too nice to people is actually weirding them out. \n\n\nI have no real passions for anything and nothing to really talk to anyone about because of it. I can talk about stuff I saw on T.V., what I did at work, small talk about stupid things. But no substance. \n\n\nSo. I'm in the process of picking out a few potential passions and am compiling a list of some things to try out myself, maybe something on my list will inspire you. \n\n\nSo far on my list I've got: taking a ceramics class, taking a painting class, join a rock climbing gym, kick boxing, learn archery, start going to concerts (and not drinking at them), hiking group if I could find one, horse riding, and I'm even considering joining an improv group cuz I think it will help me get out of my shell and meet some fun people.\n\n\nPick a list of some things you think you could be potentially passionate about. I get depression takes that away passion but just try to pick some things that maybe you used like as a child or you thought were cool to see as an adult. Ex: I always wanted a horse as a child but never rode one, so horseback riding is on the list. I saw the movies Brave and Hunger Games with my family and thought lady archers were cool as hell, archery goes on the list. I saw the Avengers movies and thought Black Widow kicking the shit out of dudes was cool as hell, kick boxing goes on the list. \n\n\nDon't try to do all of the things at once, just have a short little list of hobbies you can start trying things out and seeing if anything really speaks to you. I even have a second list for things that pique my interest but don't want to do right now for whatever reason.  \n\n\nAnd severely cut down but hopefully just quit drinking compleltley. It helps a considerable amount, alcohol worsens depression over time and only relieves it temporarily. Maybe pay a  visit r/stopdrinking \n\n\nI haven't started doing any of this but I really think it will help. I'm so tired of blanking when people ask \"what are your hobbies?\" I realized the other day that when you're making small talk with someone and they ask you that, it probably means they like your vibe and are looking to potentially hang out. When I just say \"watching TV\" or whatever, it seems standoffish. \n\n\nIt's ok that you're depressed and \"have no reason to be.\" You do have reasons. Your brain is mean and you have no hobbies or social network. Those last two things go hand in hand with each other and with depression. \n\n\nI wish you strength, friend.",
                "Dude, you gotta stop drinking. Its killing your brain cells and making you feel worse every day that you do. If anything I'd recommend smoking weed again. Weed is the only reason im alive today (ive scarcely had access to therapy, meds, etc). But regardless, you have to be willing to change your mindset and learn how to be happy again. You have to look within yourself and figure out what is making you feel like life is no longer worth living; whats truly hurting you. I don't think you want to die, i just think you want to stop feeling pain and I loneliness. I also feel like you might be using the alcohol to avoid whats making you feel so terrible. Thats why i use weed, it relaxes my body and mind so im not panicking and if i take the time to truly think about the feelings im dealing with right then, feel them, and sort it out, i feel better afterwards and should it come back i can cope a little better. When you start to spiral into a bad place try to find coping mechanisms that can pull you back to reality. Try to find yourself again and remember what used to make you happy, but you have to keep trying every day, even the hardest ones (and should a hard day come just post your thoughts here!). Every day just continue trying to learn about yourself and continue thinking about what you really want (happiness, success, friends, a girl,etc). If you keep that mindset and try every day it will push you to places you wouldnt imagine. Do not be afraid of yourself, learn to love and care for yourself, right now you need to nurturing and I know you can try.",

He usually works weekends so I'm left alone in our little studio and that's when I'm the most depressed. I miss having girlfriends or just hanging out with my family. I actually met my boyfriend through the dating app, \"Bumble.\" If you haven't given them a try, download Bumble or other dating apps! You can meet friends that way too. It's easier said than done but I can relate as to \"why don't people want to be friends with me?\" I feel like people in their 20's in bigger cities want nothing to do with other people, it's so weird..

                "&gt;Everyone has a right to feel down sometimes.  I have been suicidal before...and me personally, the drugs they gave me to take....only made things worse...i had to stop cold turkey what i was taking...even though it freaked me out...the side effects were just getting so bad.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Alcohol is one of those things....I do too...and when i first catch a buzz it feels great...but that first beer is always the best...maybe the second one is pretty good too...but after each one...the thrill increases less...and I often  do what you do...drink until i'm tired and ready to go to sleep and wake up feeling like shit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have started to acknowledge that the things i do...drinking...smoking weed...other things...are definitely to fill a void.  Loneliness is a bitch and perhaps you recognize this as one of your underlying problems as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lately, my advice to everybody feeling down...is 'Go to a museum'....lol...i don't know...i guess that probably sounds dumb....but anything that might end up inspiring you in a positive way...or that you find interesting could be a good thing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Going to the gym is great!  And going to the bar once in awhile...its ok if you ask me.  But neither of those places are good for meeting women in my opinion...and if you never go anywhere else...who else will you meet but barflys and gym rats?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You could consider taking up a new hobby like bikeriding...or photography, or go to a play ...or open mic....or even a protest or gathering or community event of some kind.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are a lot of people like you...hoping to make a meaningful connection that find themselves at places like that...for the same exact reasons....maybe they need some community to...friends...and an environment where they feel like they can meet people and have more positive experiences.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have met a girlfriend or two at bars in the past ...but it probably also set the wrong tone for our relationship...and we probably began to see (each other) as negative influences.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You might find that it's not the people (not you...and not them) that are bad...but the environment that is lacking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sports can be a great thing.  I started playing pick up basketball and it was a lot of fun for me....though....I myself...(bit of an asshole...sometimes fight too much).  If your company has a softball team...or something like that it could be a good option.  Or you could try one of those races....or crossfit...or something where people are there to be part of a team..or help each other out....or just push themselves in a more positive direction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes, the best thing to do....is something totally different.  Perhaps something you've never thought of before.  You might have to experiment a bit before you find something(s) that you enjoy and people that you like/interest you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bars are lonely places....and some people spend their lives in them.  I was a bartender for 5 years...and I know the life.  If you really love bars....consider joining a pool league and working on your game while making some new friends and playing on a team.  It's not a bad way to meet people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But there's probably also a lot of healthier options out there...chess....community gardening....camping/hiking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Check out your local 'meetup' groups and see if any of them sound interesting or fun to you.  You don't have to be a fanatic for any of those things....just someone willing to explore a new interest.

            "question": "To those who are contemplating suicide as a solution to their struggles:\nOn March 28th I committed suicide. I say \"commited suicide\" vs. \"attempted suicide\" because I didn't attempt anything. I made the active decision to end my life and followed through with it. \nPersonally I am bi-polar with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. To say that I have struggled throughout my life is an understatement. Before this I have no history of physical self-harm. I quantify my reference to self-harm as \"physical\" because a lot of my behaviors and actions in other areas could be viewed as a different form of self-harm.\nThat day I was at work and had a terrible headache. I decided to go home for the day and tend to it. I have a history of missing work due to my instability and have even lost jobs over it. My very patient and loving husband was understandably frustrated with my leaving early again. We got into a bit of a spat and in a split second random decision I was going to kill myself. I enacted a plan, partially researched and partially from years of working in the pharmaceutical industry. I put together a cocktail of medications that would suppress my respiratory system until I finally stopped breathing. Before taking this medications I took phenergan to make sure that i didn't throw up my cocktail. \nThrough text messages, calls, and facetime my husband realized that something was wrong. When he got home to me I was already aspirating and violently coughing. I had taken the medications 2 hours prior. He immediately called 911 and was told to secure the animals so that EMS could quickly get to me. He heard the sirens outside but due to our apartment complex being very confusing he knew that they were struggling to find us. In what I'm sure was the most terrifying decision of his life he left me in bed and ran downstairs to lead the paramedics to our apartment. \nBy the time I made it to the hospital, all of the medications has been processed in my body and there was no point in trying to pump my stomach. I was in the ICU for 3 days, intubated and on the verge of death. \nLuckily I pulled through and made a full recovery. Had my husband been 5 or 10 minutes later getting home, I wouldn't be writing this post. I immediately went from the hospital to a treatment facility in Tennessee called the Ranch. I was there for 4 weeks and it was an incredibly life-changing experience. I highly recommend it to anyone with mental health or addiction issues. The Ranch is widely considered to be one of the best treatment centers in the country.\nMy point in sharing all of this is that I have seen first hand the effects that suicide has on your family and friends. It is a terrible decision that is selfish and uncaring. I will never forget the state that my family was in when I regained consciousness. It was devastating. \nTo anyone who is considering suicide, please find another option. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, and it is not worth it.",

                "You're right, it's not worth it. \nIt will never be worth it. \nWhen I was 17 my life was out if my control. I won't go into details but it was a very bad point in my life. I had a plan, but before I enacted it, I went to my mother and explained how I was feeling. She told me to stop attention seeking and go away. So, I went. I wrote my letter, and I left my house that night with a knife after taking my own cocktail. I wanted to make sure I would succeed. So I went into the woods close to the house, I laid down, and I took the knife to my arms. Vertically. I can't describe the feeling of knowing you're going to die. I felt it. In the distance I could barely hear someone calling my name. It was not my family. It was a friend. He found me laying in the woods, covered in my own filth, as that's what happens when you die. I didn't even have the strength to move my eyes. I saw the look on his face and felt his tears on my skin. He had a bad feeling about me so he went to find me. I remember hearing him screaming frantically to someone else \"I found her oh my God please help I found her she's dying I don't know what to do please help\" as he held my practically lifeless body in his arms sobbing at me to please hold on, that help was coming, to please stay with him, and thats the last thing I remember. I remember being somewhere white and sterile, and was asked if I knew where I was. I could barely say no and I was told we were going to the hospital and I was going to be okay. I checked out again, and the next memory I have is waking up in a different car, with a different man. He asked me again if I knew where I was. I told him that no, I didn't know where I was. He told me that he was a transporter, and that he was taking me to the nearest adolescent psychiatry ward. I stayed there 18 days. In that time, I received no help, but for some reason I just couldn't will myself to die. Something was nagging in the back of my mind \"you promised, you can't.\" Four years later, I remembered all of this. At first I only remembered leaving the house and waking up in the psych ward. \nThat night as I lay dying in the woods, I realized that I was in love, and I would do ANYTHING in my power to never, ever see that look on his face ever again. But, my mind repressed the trauma, so I never even realized that I was in love. My relationships were not fulfilling. I went from abuser to abuser, because I was convinced that was all I deserved. I came out of my last abusive relationship and was talking with the friend who found me when all of the sudden I remembered EVERYTHING. \nWe got engaged in March, and while I still struggle with Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD, I'm receiving treatment and working with my doctors. It can get better. It WILL get better. Suicide is not painless. Please talk to someone. Please get help if you feel like you are unsafe. On behalf of everyone who cares about you, including myself, I just want to remind you that you are worth it. You are important. You are so very loved. You are not a burden. You don't have to do this on your own."

My family isnt that supportive they like drama. Tomorrow is my last day in this hotel and i got nowhere to go. I was thinking of ending it. My suffering has gone further then i ever wanted it to go. I contacted suicide prevention and talked with them for an hour. Result: \u201cwe cant help you any further please contact your doctor\u201d. Im feeling suicidal and im ready to give up. I told myself if nothing  changes is my situation by midnight i will just do it. Nothing can cheer me up. Everything is a pain. Nobody actually listens and they dont care if i live or die(words spoken by my mom). I dont know if my vision is obscurred bc of my depression or that there is just no options left. Please give me some guidance. I beg you reddit.",
